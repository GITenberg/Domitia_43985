          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Flashes as of
          lightning shot from each side of a galley as she was being rowed
          into port. She was a bireme, that is to say, had two tiers of oars;
          and as simultaneously the double sets were lifted, held for a
          moment suspended, wet with brine, feathered, and again dipped,
          every single blade gleamed, reflecting the declining western sun,
          and together formed a flash from each side of the vessel of a sheaf
          of rays.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bireme was
          approaching the entrance to the harbor of Cenchræa.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The one white
          sail was filled with what little wind breathed, and it shone
          against a sapphire sea like a moon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, at a signal
          the oars ceased to plunge. The sail was furled, and the galley was
          carried into the harbor between the temple that stood on the
          northern horn of the mole, and the great brazen statue of
          Posei<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span><a name=
          "Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>don that occupied a
          rock in the midst of the entrance, driven forward by the impulse
          already given her by the muscles of the rowers and the east wind in
          the sail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Cenchræan
          harbor into which she swept was one of the busiest in the world.
          Through it as through a tidal sluice rushed the current of trade
          from the East to the West, and from the Occident to the Orient. It
          was planted on a bay of the Saronic Gulf, and on the Isthmus of
          Corinth, at the foot of that lovely range of mountains thrown up by
          the hand of God to wall off the Peloponnesus as the shrine of
          intellectual culture and the sanctuary of Liberty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And a
          furrow—like an artificial dyke—ran between this range and Hellas
          proper, a furrow nearly wholly invaded by the sea, but still
          leaving a strip of land, the Corinthian isthmus, to form a barrier
          between the Eastern and the Western worlds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the platform
          at the head of a flight of marble steps before a temple of
          Poseidon, in her open litter, lounged a lady, with the bloom of
          youth gone from her face, but artificially restored.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was
          handsome, with finely moulded features and a delicate white hand,
          the fingers studded with rings, and a beautiful arm which was
          exposed whenever any one drew near whose admiration was worth the
          acquisition. Its charm was enhanced by armlets of gold adorned with
          cameos.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her arched
          brows, dark in color, possibly owed their perfection of turn and
          their depth of color to dye and the skill of the artist who
          decorated her every day, but not so the violet-blue of her large
          eyes, although these also were enhanced in effect by the tinting of
          the lashes, and a touch of paint applied to their
          roots.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady, whose
          name was Longa Duilia, was attended by female slaves, who stood
          behind the litter, and by a freedman, Plancus, who was at her side
          with a set smile on his waxen face, and who bowed towards the lady
          every moment to hear her remarks, uttered in a languid tone, and
          without her troubling to turn her head to address him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-corr">He</span> will soon be
          here,”</span> said the lady; <span class="tei tei-q">“the bireme is
          in the port. I can see the ruffle before her bows as she cuts the
          water.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Like the wave in my lady’s hair,”</span> sighed
          Plancus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Abominable!”</span> exclaimed Duilia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when the ripple in my hair is natural and abiding, and
          that in the water is made and disappears.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Because, Mistress, the wavelets look up, see, and fall

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That is better,”</span> said the lady.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And the swelling sail, like your divine bosom, has
          fallen, as when——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ugh! I should hope the texture of my skin was not like
          coarse sail-cloth; get behind me, Plancus. Here, Lucilla, how am I
          looking? I would have my lord see me to the best
          advantage.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam,”</span> said the female slave, advancing,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the envious sun is about to hide his head
          in the west. He cannot endure, after having feasted on your beauty,
          to surrender it to a mortal.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Is not one eyebrow a trifle higher than the
          other?”</span> asked Duilia, looking at herself in a hand mirror of
          polished metal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is indeed so, lady, but has not the Paphian Goddess
          in the statue of Phidias the same characteristic? Defect it is not,
          but a token of divinity.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah,”</span> said Duilia, <span class="tei tei-q">“it
          is hereditary. The Julian race descends from Venus Genetrix, and I
          have the blood of the immortal ancestress in me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Much diluted,”</span> muttered Plancus into the breast
          of his tunic; he was out of humor at the failure of his little
          simile of the sail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the way,”</span> said the lady; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the stay in this place Cenchræa is positively
          intolerable. No society, only a set of merchants—rich and all that
          sort of thing—but nobodies. The villa we occupy is undignified and
          uncomfortable. The noise of the port, the caterwauling of sailors,
          and the smell of pitch are most distasteful to me. My lord will
          hardly tarry here?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> said the freedman, pushing forward,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he who subdued the Parthians, and chained
          the Armenians, to whom all Syria bowed, arrives to cast himself at
          your ladyship’s feet, and be led by you as a captive in your
          triumphal entry into the capital of the world.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You think so, Plancus.”</span> She shook her head,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He is an obstinate man—pig-headed—I—I mean
          resolute in his own line.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, I know you to be irresistible.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, I desire to leave this odious place. I have
          yawned here through three entire months.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And during these months, the temple of Aphrodite has
          been deserted, and the approaches grass-grown.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How would my Lady like to remove to Corinth?”</span>
          said Lucilla. <span class="tei tei-q">“The vessel will be taken to
          Diolcus, and there placed on rollers, to be drawn across the
          isthmus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh! Corinth will be noisier than this place, and more
          vulgar, because more pretentious. Only money-lending Jews there.
          Besides, I have taken an aversion <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          As the Gods love me, I not see the good of a medical attendant who
          is so ignorant as to allow himself to die, and that at such an
          inconvenient moment as the present. By the Great Goddess! what
          impostors there be. To think that for years I committed the care of
          my precious health to his bungling hands! Plancus, have you secured
          another? I suffer frightfully at sea.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          on his unctuous face, <span class="tei tei-q">“you may rest
          satisfied that no harm has befallen the young lady. So long as
          Eboracus is with her, she is safe. That Briton worships her. He
          would suffer himself to be torn limb from limb rather than allow
          the least ill to come to her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, well,”</span> said the lady impatiently,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“we expect all that sort of thing of our
          slaves.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, but do we always get it?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We! The Gods save me! How you talk. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We!</span></span> We,
          indeed. Pray what are you to expect anything?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The other day, lady,”</span> hastily continued the
          steward eager to allay the ebullition he had provoked. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The other day, Eboracus nigh on killed a man who
          looked with an insolent leer at his young mistress. He is like a
          faithful Molossus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I do not ask what he is like,”</span> retorted the
          still ruffled lady, <span class="tei tei-q">“I ask where she
          is.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one of the
          porters of the palanquin came forward respectfully and said to the
          steward:—<span class="tei tei-q">“If it may please you, sir, will
          you graciously report to my Lady that I observed the young mistress
          draw Eboracus aside, and whisper to him, as though urging somewhat,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg008"
          id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and he seemed to demur, but
          he finally appeared to yield to her persuasions, and they strolled
          together along the mole.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia
          overheard this. It was not the etiquette for an underling to
          address his master or mistress directly unless spoken to.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She said
          sharply:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Why did not the fellow mention
          this before? Give him thirty lashes. Where did they go, did he
          say?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Along the mole.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Which mole?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, Carpentarius is afraid of extending his
          communication lest he increase the number of his
          lashes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, well!”</span> exclaimed the mistress,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We may remit the lashes—let him
          answer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Carpentarius,”</span> said the steward, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Her ladyship, out of the superabundance of her
          compassion, will let you off the thirty lashes, if you say where be
          Eboracus and the young lady, your mistress Domitia
          Longina.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> answered the porter, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that I cannot answer positively; but—unless my eyes
          deceive me, I see a small boat on the water, within it a rower and
          a young girl.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the Immortal Brothers! he is right,”</span>
          exclaimed Plancus. <span class="tei tei-q">“See, lady, yonder is a
          cockle boat, that has been unmoored from the mole, and there be in
          it a rower, burly, broadbacked, who is certainly the Briton, and in
          the bow is as it were a silver dove—and that can be none other than
          your daughter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As the Gods love me,”</span> gasped Duilia, throwing
          herself back in the litter; <span class="tei tei-q">“what
          indelicacy! It is even so, the child is besotted. She dotes on her

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was even
          so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young girl
          had coaxed the big Briton to take her in a boat to the galley, so
          as to meet and embrace her father, before he came on shore.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was a
          peculiarly affectionate child, and jealous to boot. She knew that,
          so soon as he landed, his whole attention would be engrossed by her
          very exacting mother, who moreover would keep her in the
          background, and would chide should the father divert his notice
          from herself to his child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was
          therefore determined to be the first to salute him, and to receive
          his endearments, and to lavish on him her affection, unchecked by
          her mother.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for the
          slave, he knew that he would get into trouble if he complied with
          the girl’s request, but he was unable to resist her
          blandishments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Domitia
          reached the side of the galley, and a rope was cast to the boat,
          caught by Eboracus, who shipped his oars, and the little skiff was
          made fast to the side of the vessel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eyes of the
          father had already recognized his child. Domitia stood in the bows
          and extended her arms, poised on tiptoe, as if, like a bird about
          to leap into the air and fly to his embrace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now he
          caught her hand, looked into her dancing, twinkling eyes, as drops
          of the very Ægean itself, set in her sweet face, and in another
          moment she was clinging round his neck, and sobbing as though her
          heart would break, yet not with sorrow, but through excess of
          otherwise inexpressible joy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For an hour she
          had him to herself—all to herself—the dear father whom she had not
          seen for half a year, to tell him how she loved him, to hear about
          himself, to pour into his ear her story of pleasures and pains,
          great pleasures and trifling pains.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet—no, not
          wholly uninterrupted was the meeting and sweet converse, for the
          father said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My darling, hast thou no word for Lucius?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lamia! He is here?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The father,
          Cnæus Domitius Corbulo, with a smile turned and beckoned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then a young
          man, with pleasant, frank face, came up. He had remained at a
          distance, when father and daughter met, but had been unable to
          withdraw his eyes from the happy group.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia, you have not forgotten your old playmate,
          have you?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a light
          blush like the tint on the petal of the rose of June, the girl
          extended her hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay!”</span> said Corbulo. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A gentler, kinder greeting, after so long a
          separation.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she held up
          her modest cheek, and the young man lightly touched it with his
          lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She drew herself
          away and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You will not be angry if I give all my thoughts and
          words and looks to my father now. When we come on shore, he will be
          swallowed up by others.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia stepped
          back.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Do not be offended,”</span> she said with a smile, and
          the loveliest, most bewitching dimples came into her cheeks.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not indeed been without thought of
          you, Lucius, but have spun and spun and weaved too, enough to make
          you a tunic, all with my own hands, and a purple <span lang="la"

          not say; but I wove little crossed L’s into the
          texture.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What,”</span> said Corbulo. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For Lucius and Longina?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl became
          crimson.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia came to
          her succor. <span class="tei tei-q">“That could not be,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“for Longina and Lucius are never
          across, but alack! Lucius is often so with Lamia, when he has done
          some stupid thing and he sees a frown on his all but father’s face,
          but hears no word of reproach.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My boy,”</span> said Corbulo, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when a man knows his own faults, then a reprimand is
          unnecessary, and what is unnecessary is wrong.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia bowed and
          retired.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now again
          father and daughter were alone together in the prow observing the
          arc of the harbor in which the ship was gliding smoothly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the
          sailors had out their poles and hooks, and they ran the vessel
          beside the wharf, and cast out ropes that were made fast to bronze
          rings in the marble breasting of the quay.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia would at
          once have drawn her father on shore, but he restrained her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Not yet, my daughter,”</span> he said; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the goddess must precede thee.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now ensued a
          singular formality.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg
          13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the bows of
          the vessel, the captain and steerer took a statuette of Artemis, in
          bronze, the Ephesian goddess, with female head and numerous
          breasts, but with the lower limbs swaddled, and the swaddling bands
          decorated with representations of all kinds of beasts, birds, and
          fishes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This image was
          now conveyed on shore, followed by the passengers and crew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the quay
          stood an altar, upon which charcoal ever burnt, under the charge of
          a priest who attended to it continuously, and whenever a ship
          entered the port or was about to leave, added fuel, and raked and
          blew up the fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simultaneously
          from a small temple on the quay issued a priest with veiled head,
          and his attendants came to the altar, cast some grains of incense
          on the embers, and as the blue fragrant smoke arose and was
          dissipated by the sea breeze, he said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Goddess Aphrodite of Corinth salutes her divine
          sister, the Many-Breasted Artemis of Ephesus, and welcomes her. And
          she further prays that she may not smite the city or the port with
          fire, pestilence or earthquake.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then captain,
          steerman, pilot and the rest of the company advanced in procession
          to the temple, and on reaching it offered a handful of sweet gums
          on an altar there, before the image of the foam-born goddess of
          Beauty, and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We who come from the sea, having safely traversed the
          Ægean, escaped rocks and sand-banks, whirlpools and storms, under
          the protection of the great goddess of Ephesus, salute in her name
          the goddess of Beauty, and receive her welcome with thankfulness.
          And great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg
          14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Artemis beseeches her sister to suffer her and
          the vessel with passengers and goods and crew, that she conducts
          and protects, to pass across the isthmus, without let and
          molestation; and she for her part undertakes to pay the accustomed
          toll, and the due to the temple of Aphrodite, and that neither the
          passengers nor the crew shall in any way injure or disturb the
          inhabitants of Corinth or of the Isthmus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ceremony
          concluded, all were at liberty to disperse; the sailors to attend
          to the vessel, the slaves of Corbulo to look to and land such of
          his luggage as he was likely to want, and Corbulo to go to his
          wife, who had placed herself in an attitude to receive him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The captain, at
          the same time, entered the harbor-master’s office to arrange about
          the crossing of the isthmus, and to settle tolls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the vessel
          was not to make more stay than a few days at the port of Cenchræa.
          After Longa Duilia was ready, then she and her husband and family
          were to proceed to Lechæum, the port on the Corinthian Gulf, there
          to embark for Italy. The vessel would leave the harbor and go to
          Diolchus, that point of the Isthmus on the east where the neck of
          land was narrowest. There the ships would be hauled out of the
          water, placed on rollers, and by means of oxen, assisted by gangs
          of slaves, would convey the vessel over the land for six miles to
          the Gulf of Corinth, where again she would be floated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately
          behind the Roman general, Corbulo, the father of Domitia, walked
          two individuals, both wearing long beards, and draped to the
          feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of these had
          a characteristically Oriental head. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>His eyes were set very close together, his
          nose was aquiline, his tint sallow, his eyebrows heavy and bushy,
          and his general expression one of cunning and subtlety. His
          movements were stately.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other was
          not so tall. He was clumsy in movement, rugged in feature, with a
          broken nose, his features distinctly Occidental, as was his bullet
          head. His hair was sandy, and scant on his crown. He wore a smug,
          self-complacent expression on his pursed-up lips and had a certain
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Sir Oracle, let no dog bark”</span>
          look in his pale eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These two men,
          walking side by side, eyed each other with ill-concealed dislike
          and disdain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The former was a
          Chaldæan, who was usually called Elymas, but affected in Greek to
          be named Ascletarion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter was
          an Italian philosopher who had received his training in Greece at a
          period when all systems of philosophy were broken up and jostled
          each other in their common ruin.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner was
          the ceremony at an end, and Corbulo had hastened from the wharf to
          meet and embrace his wife, and Lamia had drawn off Domitia for a
          few words, than these two men left to themselves instinctively
          turned to launch their venom at each other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The philosopher,
          with a toss of his beard, and a lifting of his light eyebrows, and
          the protrusion of his lower lip said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And pray, what has the profundity of Ascletarion alias
          Elymas beheld in the bottom of that well he terms his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cnæus Domitius
          Corbulo was the greatest general of his time, and he had splendidly
          served the State.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His sister
          Cæsonia had been the wife of the mad prince Caligula. She was not
          beautiful, but her flexible mouth, her tender eyes, the dimples in
          her cheeks, her exquisite grace of manner and sweetness of
          expression had not only won the heart of the tyrant, but had
          enabled her to maintain it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once, in an
          outburst of surprise at himself for loving her, he threatened to
          put her to the torture to wring from Cæsonia the secret of her hold
          on his affections. Once, as he caressed her, he broke into hideous
          laughter, and when asked the reason, said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have but to speak the word, and this lovely throat
          would be cut.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet this woman
          loved the maniac, and when he had been murdered in the subterranean
          gallery leading from the palace to the theatre, she crept to the
          spot, and was found kneeling by her dead husband with their babe in
          her arms, sobbing and wiping the blood from his face. The assassins
          did not spare her. They cut her down and dashed out the brains of
          the infant against the marble walls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corbulo was not
          only able, he was successful. Under <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Nero he was engaged in the East against the
          Parthians, the most redoubted enemies of the empire. He broke their
          power and sent their king, Tiridates, a suppliant to Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His headquarters
          had been at Antioch, and there for a while his wife and daughter
          had resided with him. But after a while, they were sent part way
          homewards, as Corbulo himself expected his recall.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had been
          separated from him for over six months, and had been awaiting his
          arrival in a villa at Cenchræa, that had been placed at their
          disposal by a Greek client.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was customary
          for those who did not live in Rome but belonged to a province, to
          place themselves under the patronage of a Roman noble; whereupon
          ensued an exchange of <span class="tei tei-q">“cards”</span> as we
          should say, but actually of engraved plates or metal fishes on
          which the date of the agreement was entered as well as the names of
          the contracting parties. Then, when a provincial desired assistance
          at the capital, in obtaining redress for a grievance in a lawsuit,
          or in recovering a debt, his patron attended to his client’s
          interests, and should he visit Rome received him into his house as
          an honored guest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, if the patron were on a journey and came to the place where
          his client could serve him, the latter threw his house open to him,
          treated him with the most profound respect and accorded to him the
          largest hospitality. So now the villa of a client had been placed
          at the disposal of Corbulo and his family, and he occupied it with
          as little hesitation as though it were his own.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a matter
          of pride to a Roman noble to have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>a large number of silver engraved plates and
          fishes suspended in his atrium, announcing to all visitors what an
          extensive <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">clientèle</span></span> he
          had, and the provincial was not less proud to be able to flourish
          the name of his distinguished patron at the capital.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the evening
          following the disembarkation, Corbulo and his wife were seated on a
          bench enjoying the pleasant air that fanned from the sea; and
          looking over the terraced garden at their daughter, who was
          gambolling with a long silky-haired kid from Cilicia, that her
          father had brought as a present to his child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was a lovely
          girl, aged sixteen, with a remarkably intelligent face, and large,
          clear, shrewd eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, though
          lovely, none could say that she was beautiful. Her charm was like
          that of her aunt, Cæsonia, in grace of form, in changefulness and
          sweetness of expression, and in the brimming intellect that flashed
          out of her violet eyes. And now as she played with the kid, her
          every movement formed an artist’s study, and the simple joy that
          shone out of her face, and the affection wherewith she glanced at
          intervals at her father, invested her with a spiritual charm,
          impossible to be achieved by sculptor with his chisel or by painter
          with his brush.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eyes of
          Domitius Corbulo followed his child, wherever she went, whatever
          she did. He was a man of somewhat advanced age, shaven, with short
          shorn hair, marked features, the brow somewhat retreating, but with
          a firm mouth and strong jaw. Though not handsome, there was
          refinement in his countenance which gave it a character of
          nobleness, and the brilliant eye and decision in the countenance
          inspired universal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg
          20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class=

          merely a commander of men in war, but a man of culture in the forum
          and the academy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Wife,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray

          every other eye, that the Roman people are impatient at having a

          having acted the buffoon in Italy, running up and down it like a
          jester on a tight-rope mouthing at the people, and with his
          assassins scattered about below to cut them down if they do not
          applaud—then he comes here also into Greece, to act on stages, race
          chariots, before Greeks—Greeks of all people! To me this is
          nothing, for all princes are tyrants more or less, and so long as

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently, when
          she was beyond hearing, he said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now about the future of Domitia. I wish her no better
          fortune than to become the wife of Lucius Ælius Lamia, whom I love
          as my son. He has been in and out among us at Antioch. He returns
          with me to Rome. In these evil times, for a girl there is one only
          chance—to be given a good husband. This I hold, that a woman is
          never bad unless man shows her the way. If, as you say, there be no

          comes Lamia, and something ails him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius was seen

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hastened to
          Corbulo, but although his lips moved, he could not utter a
          word.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You would speak with me,”</span> said the old general

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Something he saw
          there made him divine his errand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Corbulo
          turned, kissed his wife, and said—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took a step

          whose reach she held a bunch of parsley.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hesitated for
          a moment. His inclination drew him towards her; but a second

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A quarter of an
          hour had elapsed since Corbulo entered the peristyle of the villa,
          when the young man Lamia came out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was still
          pale as death, and his muscles twitched with strong emotion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He glanced about
          him in quest of Longa Duilia, but that lady had retired
          precipitately to the <span lang="grc" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="grc"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gynaikonitis</span></span>, or Lady’s hall,
          where she had summoned to her a bevy of female slaves and had
          accumulated about her an apothecary’s shop of restoratives.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          still in the garden, playing with the kid, and Lamia at once went
          to her, not speedily, but with repugnance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She immediately
          desisted from her play, and smiled at his approach. They were old
          acquaintances, and had seen much of each other in Syria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corbulo had not
          been proconsul, but legate in the East, and had made Antioch his
          headquarters. He had been engaged against the Parthians and
          Armenians for eight years, but the war had been intermittent, and
          between the campaigns he had returned to Antioch, to the society of
          his wife and little daughter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The former, a
          dashing, vain and ambitious woman, had made a <span lang="fr"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=

          "Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>best society of the
          province. Corbulo, a quiet, thoughtful and modest man, shrunk from
          the stir and emptiness of such life, and had found rest and
          enjoyment in the company of his daughter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia had served
          as his secretary and aide-de-camp. He was a youth of much promise,
          and of singular integrity of mind and purity of morals in a society
          that was self-seeking, voluptuous, and corrupt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He belonged to
          the Ælian <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">gens</span></span> or clan,
          but he had been adopted by a Lamia, a member of a family in the
          same clan, that claimed descent from Lamius, a son of Poseidon, or
          Neptune, by one of those fictions so dear to the Roman noble
          houses, and which caused the fabrication of mythical origins, just
          as the ambition of certain honorable families in England led to the
          falsification of the Roll of Battle Abbey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pliny tells a
          horrible story of the first Lamia of importance, known to authentic
          history. He had been an adherent of Cæsar and a friend of Cicero.
          He was supposed to be dead in the year in which he had been elected
          prætor, and was placed on the funeral pyre, when consciousness
          returned, but too late for him to be saved. The flames rose and
          enveloped him, and he died shrieking and struggling to escape from
          the bandages that bound him to the bier on which he lay.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius Lamia had
          been kindly treated by Corbulo, and the young man’s heart had gone
          out to the venerated general, to whom he looked up as a model of
          all the old Roman virtues, as well as a man of commanding military
          genius. The simplicity of the old soldier’s manner and the
          freshness of his mind had acted as a healthful and bracing breeze
          upon the youth’s moral character.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now he took
          the young girl by the hand, and walked with her up and down the
          pleached avenues for some moments without speaking.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His breast
          heaved. His head swam. His hand that held hers worked
          convulsively.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All at once
          Domitia stood still.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had looked
          up wondering at his manner, into his eyes, and had seen that they
          were full.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What! are we not to return to Rome? O Lamia, I was a
          child when I left it, but I love our house at Gabii, and the lake
          there, and the garden.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is worse than that, Domitia.”</span> He seated
          himself on the margin of a basin, and nervously, not knowing what
          he did, drew his finger in the water, describing letters, and
          chasing the darting fish.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And still he
          thrust after the frightened fish with his finger, and she looked
          down, and saw them dart like shadows in the pool, and her own
          frightened thoughts darted as nimbly and as blindly about in her
          head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why, how now, Lamia? Thou art descended by adoption
          from the Earth-shakes, and tremblest as a girl! See—a tear fell
          into the basin. Oh, Lucius! My very kid rears in
          surprise.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia withdrew
          her eyes from the fish and the water surface rippled by his finger,
          and looked now with real terror in his face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lamia
          raised his dripping finger and pointed to the house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked, and
          saw that the gardener had torn down boughs of cypress, and
          therewith was decorating the doorway.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          moment rose a long-drawn, desolate wail, rising, falling, ebbing,
          flowing—a sea of sound infinitely sad, heart-thrilling,
          blood-congealing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For one awful
          moment, one of those moments that seems an eternity, Domitia
          remained motionless.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She could hear
          articulate words, voices now.</p>

          return!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She knew it—the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conclamatio</span></span>; that cry uttered
          about the dead in the hopes of bringing back the spirit that has
          fled.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, before
          Lamia could stop her, Domitia started from the margin of the pool,
          startling the fish again and sending them flying as rays from where
          she had been seated, and ran to the house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gardener,
          with the timidity of a slave, did not venture to forbid
          passage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A soldier who
          was withdrawing extended his arm to bar the doorway. Quick as
          thought she dived below this barrier, and next moment with a cry
          that cut through the wail of the mourners, she cast herself on the
          body of her father, that lay extended on the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mosaic floor, with a blood-stained sword
          at his side, and a dark rill running from his breast over the
          enamelled pavement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next moment
          Lamia entered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Around the hall
          were mourners, slaves of the house, as also some of those of Longa
          Duilia, raising their arms and lowering them, uttering their cries
          of lamentation and invocations to the departed soul, some rending
          their garments, others making believe to tear their hair and
          scratch their faces.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst lay
          the dead general, and his child clung to him, kissed him, chafed
          his hands, endeavored to stanch his wound, and addressed him with
          endearments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all was in
          vain. The spirit was beyond recall, and were it to return would
          again be expelled. Corbulo was dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor child
          clasped him, convulsed with tears; her copious chestnut hair had
          become unbound, and was strewed about her, and even dipped in her
          father’s blood. She was as though frantic with despair; her
          gestures, her cry very different from the formal expressions and
          utterances of the servile mourners.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Lamia at
          length touched her, and said—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come away, Domitia. You cannot prevent
          Fate.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly she
          reared herself on her knees, and put back the burnished rain of
          hair that shrouded her face, and said in harsh tones:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who slew him?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He fell on his own sword.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why! He was happy?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before an answer
          was given, she reeled and fell unconscious across her father’s
          body.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg
          31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lamia
          stooped, gathered her up tenderly, pitifully, in his arms, and bore
          her forth into the garden to the fountain, where he could bathe her
          face, and where the cool air might revive her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why was Corbulo
          dead? and why had he died by his own hand?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor Nero
          was, as Duilia had told her husband, at this very time in Greece,
          and further, hard by at Corinth, where he was engaged in
          superintending the cutting of a canal, that was to remove the
          difficulty of a passage from the Saronic to the Corinthian
          Gulf.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero had come to
          Greece attended by his Augustal band of five thousand youths with
          flowing locks, and gold bangles on their wrists, divided into three
          companies, whose duty it was to applaud the imperial mountebank,
          and rouse or lead enthusiasm, the Hummers by buzzing approval, the
          Clappers by beating their hands together, and the Clashers by
          kicking pots about so as to produce a contagious uproar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero was
          possessed with the delusion that he had a fine voice, and that he
          was an incomparable actor. Yet his range was so small, that when
          striving to sink to a bass note, his voice became a gurgle, and
          when he attempted to soar to a high note, he raised himself on his
          toes, became purple in face, and emitted a screech like a
          peacock.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not satisfied
          with the obsequious applause of the Roman and Neapolitan citizens
          who crowded the theatre to hear the imperial buffoon twitter, he
          resolved to contest for prizes in the games of Greece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A fleet attended
          him, crowded with actors, singers, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>dancers, heaped up with theatrical properties,
          masks, costumes, wigs, and fiddles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He would show
          the Greeks that he could drive a chariot, sing and strut the stage
          now in male and then in female costume, and adapt his voice to the
          sex he personated, now grumbling in masculine tones, then squeaking
          in falsetto, and incomparable in each.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But with the
          cunning of a madman, he took with him, as his court, the wealthiest
          nobles of Rome, whom he had marked out for death, either because he
          coveted their fortunes or suspected their loyalty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherever he
          went, into whatsoever city he entered, his artistic eye noted the
          finest statues and paintings, and he carried them off, from temple
          as from marketplace, to decorate Rome or enrich his Golden House,
          the palace he had erected for himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tortured by envy
          of every one who made himself conspicuous; hating, fearing such as
          were in all men’s mouths, through their achievements, or notable
          for virtue, his suspicion had for some time rested on Domitius
          Corbulo, who had won laurels first in Germany and afterwards in
          Syria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had summoned
          him to Rome, with the promise of preferments, his purpose being to
          withdraw him from the army that adored him, and to destroy him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner did
          the tidings reach the tyrant at Corinth, that the veteran hero was
          arrived at Cenchræa, than he sent him a message to commit suicide.
          A gracious condescension that, for the property of the man who was
          executed was forfeit and his wife and children reduced to beggary,
          whereas the will of the testator who destroyed himself was allowed
          to remain in force.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg
          33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia washed the
          stains from the hands and locks of the girl, and bathed her face
          with water till she came round.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, when he
          saw that she had recovered full consciousness, he asked to be
          allowed to hasten for assistance. She bowed her head, as she could
          not speak, and he entered the women’s portion of the villa to
          summon some of the female slaves. These were, however, in no
          condition to answer his call and be of use. Duilia had monopolized
          the attentions of almost all such as had not been commissioned to
          raise the funeral wail. Some, indeed, there were, scattered in all
          directions, running against each other, doing nothing save add to
          the general confusion, but precisely these were useless for Lamia’s
          purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unwilling to
          leave the child longer alone, Lucius returned to the garden, and
          saw Domitia seated on the breastwork of the fountain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten years seemed
          to have passed over her head, so altered was she.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was not now
          weeping. The rigidity of the fainting fit seemed not to have left
          her face, nor relaxed the stony appearance it had assumed. Her eyes
          were lustreless, and her lips without color.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man
          was startled at her look.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia!”</span> said he.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She raised her
          eyes to him, and said in reply,</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lucius!”</span> Then letting them fall, she added in
          hard, colorless tones, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is one thing
          I desire of thee. By some means or other, I care not what, bring me
          into the presence of the monster. I know how my father has come by
          his death—as have so many others, the best and the noblest. I have
          but one ambition on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg

          death.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Be careful of thy words. If overheard,
          they might cause your blood to be mingled with his.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          have not first been searched, and even then are not allowed within
          arm’s length. Nothing can be done, save invoke the
          Gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          a duty in my heart, and the star is unattainable, and the duty,
          they make impossible of achievement. Bah! There is no star. There
          are no duties on earth, and no Gods in heaven.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the death of
          a noble or high official, his face was immediately moulded in wax,
          into a mask, or rather, into two masks, that were colored and
          supplied with glass eyes. One was placed over the dead face, when
          the corpse lay in state, and when he was conveyed to his funeral
          pyre, and the first effect of the rising flames was to dissolve the
          mask and disclose the dead features.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ancient
          Greeks before they burned their dead laid gold-leaf masks on their
          faces, and in a still earlier time the face of the corpse was
          rouged with oxide of iron, to give it a false appearance of
          life.</p>

          gentleman or lady was carried forth to his funeral pyre, he was
          preceded by a procession <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg
          37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
          actors dressed up in the togas and military or municipal insignia
          of departed ancestors, each wearing the wax mask of him he
          personified. For these masks were preserved with great care in the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atrium</span></span> of the house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now as Longa
          Duilia saw, to have her husband burned at Cenchræa, without a
          procession of imitation ancestors, would be to deprive the funeral
          of its most impressive feature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plancus had
          advised the burning at the port, with shorn rites, and that the
          ashes should be placed in the family mausoleum at Gabii, and that
          the utmost dignity should be accorded to this latter ceremony
          sufficient to content the most punctilious widow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this did not
          please the lady. The notion of a funeral with maimed pomp was
          distasteful to her; moreover, as she argued, it was illegal to have
          two funerals for the same man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That,”</span> said Plancus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hardly applies to one who has died out of
          Italy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is against the law,”</span> replied Duilia.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will give no occasion to objection,
          offer no handle to informers. Besides, I won’t have it. The respect
          I owe to Corbulo forbids the entertainment of such an idea. Really,
          and on my word, Plancus, I am not a child to be amused with shadow
          pictures, and unless you are making a rabbit, a fish, or a pig
          eating out of a trough, I cannot conceive what you are about with
          your hands, fumbling one over the other.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, I had no thought——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know you have none. Be pleased another time when
          addressing me to keep your hands quiet, it is irritating. One never
          knows where they are or will <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>be, sometimes folding and unfolding them,
          then—they disappear up your sleeves and project none can guess
          where—like snails’ horns. Be pleased,—and now pawing your face like
          a cat washing itself. Please in future hold them in front of you
          like a dog when sitting up, begging. But as to the funeral—I will
          not have it cheap and nasty. Without ancestors a funeral is not
          worth having.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said the harassed freedman, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is nothing for it but to engage an
          embalmer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of course—one can be obtained at Corinth. Everything
          can be had for money.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Plancus was
          retiring, the lady recalled him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“do
          not act like a fool, and let the man charge a fancy price. Say that
          I have an idea of pickling Corbulo in brine, and have brought an
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amphora</span></span> large enough for the
          purpose. Don’t close with his terms at once.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the steward
          was gone, then Longa Duilia turned her head languidly and summoned
          a slave-girl.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lucilla! The unfortunate feature of the situation is
          that I must not have my hair combed till we reach Gabii. It is
          customary, and for a bracelet of pearls I would not transgress
          custom. You can give my head a tousled look, without being
          dishevelled, I would wish to appear interesting, not
          untidy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady! Nothing could make you other than fascinating. A
          widow in tears—some stray locks—it would melt marble.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And I think I shall outdo Agrippina,”</span> said
          Duilia, <span class="tei tei-q">“she carried her husband’s cinders
          in an urn at the head of her berth and on appropriate occasions
          howled in the most tragic and charming manner. But I shall

          my Corbulo in state exposed on his bier, in his military
          accoutrements all the way to Rhegium, then up the coast to Ostia
          and so to Gabii. There will be talk!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You will be cited in history as a widow the like of
          which the world has never seen. As for Agrippina, in your superior
          blaze she will be eclipsed forever.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I should prefer doing what Agrippina did—make a land
          journey from Brindisium, but—but—one must consider. It would be
          vastly expensive, and——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the lady did
          not finish the sentence. She considered that Nero might resent such
          a demonstration, as exciting indignation against himself, in having
          obliged Corbulo to put an end to his life. But she did not dare to
          breathe her thought even into the ear of a slave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> she said; <span class="tei tei-q">“it
          would come too expensive. I will do what I can to honor my husband,
          but not ruin myself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Longa
          Duilia had resolved to have her own way, and that was always, then
          all the entire family of slaves and retainers, freedmen and clients
          knew it must be done.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vessel after
          a brief stay at Cenchræa had left for Diolcus where it had been
          placed on rollers and conveyed across the isthmus, and was launched
          in the Corinthian Gulf.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero had been
          engaged for some days in excavating a canal between the two seas.
          He had himself turned the first sod, but after getting some little
          way, rock was encountered of so hard a quality that to cut through
          it would cost time, toil and money.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He speedily
          tired of the scheme, wanted the money <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>it would have cost for some dramatic
          exhibition, and was urged by Helios, a freedman whom he had left in
          Rome, to return to Italy, to prevent an insurrection that was
          simmering. Nero did not much believe in danger, but he had laden
          his fleet with the plunder of Greece, he had strutted and twittered
          on every stage, carried off every prize in every contest, and was
          desirous of being applauded in Italy and at Rome for what he had
          achieved, and exhibit there the chaplets he had won.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly he
          started, and hardly had he done so before the Artemis with spread
          sail swept down the Corinthian Gulf.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ship, a
          Liburnian, of two banks of oars, was constructed very differently
          from a modern vessel. The prow was armed above water-mark with
          three strong and sharp blades, called the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rostra</span></span>, the beaks, which when
          driven into the side of an enemy would tear her open and sink
          her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The quarter-deck
          was midships, and served a double purpose, being raised as high as
          the bulwarks it served as an elevated place where the captain could
          stand and survey the horizon and watch the course of the vessel,
          and it also served to strengthen the mast.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this
          quarter-deck, on a bed of state, lay the body of Cnæus Domitius
          Corbulo, with his sword at his side, and the wax mask over his
          face. At his feet was a tripod with glowing coals on which
          occasionally incense and Cilician crocus were sprinkled, and on
          each side of his head blazed torches of pinewood dipped in
          pitch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poop had a
          covered place, called the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aplaustre</span></span>, in which sat the
          steerer. The hinged rudder had not then been invented, it was a
          discovery of the Middle <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg
          41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Ages, and the head of the vessel was given its
          direction by the helmsman, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gubernator</span></span>, who worked a pair of
          broad flat paddles, one on each side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rowers,
          under the deck, were slaves, but the sailors were freemen. The
          rowers were kept in stroke by a piper, who played continually when
          the vessel was being propelled; and the rowers were under the
          direction and command of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hortator</span></span>, so called because his
          voice was incessantly heard, urging, reprimanding, praising,
          threatening.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The captain of a
          Roman vessel was not supreme in authority on board ship as with us,
          but if the vessel contained military, he was subject to the control
          of the superior military officer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage down
          the Corinthian Bay was effected without difficulty, before a
          favorable wind, but as the vessel was about to pass out of it, the
          wind suddenly changed and blew a squall from the west. And at this
          moment an accident occurred that was seriously embarrassing. Whilst
          the captain was standing near the steersman giving him directions
          relative to the passage of the straits, a wave rolling in caught
          the paddle, and caused it by the blow to snap the bronze bolt of
          the eye in which it worked, and the handle flying up and forward,
          struck the captain on the forehead, threw him down, and he fell
          against the bulwark so as to cut open his head. He had to be
          carried below insensible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Artemis lay
          under shelter till the gale abated, and then consultation arose as
          to what was to be done.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius Lamia
          took the command, he was competent to manage the vessel, with the
          advice, if needed, of the mate. He and all were reluctant to put
          back to Lechæum, the port of Corinth, on the Gulf, and the broken
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042"
          id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>eye in which the paddle
          worked was repaired with a stout thong, which, as the steersman
          said, would hold till Adria was crossed and Rhegium was
          reached.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The squall had
          passed, and the look of the sky was promising; moreover the wind
          was again favorable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said the mate, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my opinion is that we should make all speed across
          Adria. This is a bad season of the year. It is a month in which
          sailing is overpassed. We must take advantage of our chances. While
          the wind blows, let us spread sail. The rowers can ship their oars;
          should the wind fail, or prove contrary, they will be required, and
          they may have a hard time of it. Therefore let them husband their
          strength.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“So be it,”</span> answered Lucius Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the
          Artemis, with sail spread, leaning on one side, drave through the
          rippling water, passed the Straits into the Adriatic, with the
          mountains of Ætolia to the north, and the island of Cephalonia in
          the blue west before her; and as she flew, she left behind her a
          trail of foam in the water, and a waft of smoke in the air from the
          torches that glowed about the dead general on the quarter-deck.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was in
          decline, and although the season was winter yet the air was not
          cold. The mountains of Greece lay in the wake like a bank of purple
          cloud tinged with gold.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the
          quarter-deck reposed the corpse, with the feet turned in the
          direction of the prow; the torches spluttered, and cast off sparks
          that flew away with the smoke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On each side
          were three slave women, detailed to wail, but Longa Duilia had
          issued instructions that they were not to be noisy in their
          demonstration so as to disturb or swamp conversation aft.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The undulating
          lament swerving through semi-tones and demi-semitones, formed a low
          and sad background to the play of voices on the lower deck, where,
          sheltered from the wind, the widow reclined on cushions, and her
          daughter Domitia sat at her side in conversation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A change had
          come over the girl, so complete, so radical, that she seemed hardly
          to be the same person as before her father’s death. This was
          noticeable as being in appearance and manner,—noticeable even to
          the slaves, not the most observant in matters that did not
          particularly concern their comfort and interests. <span class=

          child into a sad and serious woman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sparkle had
          left her eyes to make way for an eager, searching fire. The color
          had left her cheek; and her face had assumed a gloomy expression.
          The change, in fact, was much like that in a landscape when a sunny
          May day makes place for one that is overcast and threatening. The
          natural features are unaltered, but the aspect is wholly different
          in quality and character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A mighty sorrow
          contracting, bruising, oppressing the heart sometimes melts it into
          a sweetness of patient endurance that inspires pity and love. But
          grief seemed to have frozen Domitia and not to have dissolved her
          into tears.</p>

          before Luke could answer, Lamia, who had been in the fore part of
          the vessel, came hastily aft, and disregarding the physician,
          heedless of the conversation on which he broke in, said hurriedly

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia leaped
          to her feet. Everything was forgotten in the one thought that
          before her, on the sea, floated the man who had caused the death of
          her father.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lucius I must see——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He drew her
          forward, but at the same time checked her speech.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Every word dropped is fraught with danger,”</span> he

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is not that,”</span> she answered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“show him to me—him——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They walked
          together to the bows.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          declining of the sun, the light wind had died away, and, although
          the sea heaved after the recent storm, like the bosom of a sleeping
          girl, in the stillness of the air, the sail drooped and the ship
          made no way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly the
          sail was furled, and, by the advice of the mate, the rowers, who
          had rested during the day, were summoned to their benches and
          bidden work the oars during the night.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sky was
          clear, and the stars were beginning to twinkle. No part of the
          voyage in calm weather would be less dangerous than this, which
          might be performed at night, across open sea, unbroken by rocks and
          sand-banks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as the
          vessel had to thread her way between the headland of Araxus and the
          Echinades, and then betwixt the isles of Cephalonia and Zacynthus,
          an experienced navigator was necessary, and caution had to be
          exercised both in the management of the sail and in the
          manipulation of the helm. But now all was plain, and the mate had
          retired below to rest. During the time he reposed Lamia took charge
          of the vessel, assisted by the second mate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You take your meridian by Polaris, Castor and Pollux,
          steer due west; if there be a slight deviation from the right
          course, that is a trifle. I will set it right when my watch
          comes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
          mate’s injunction as he retired below.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The steersman is done up,”</span> said Lamia;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he shall rest now, and no better man can
          be found to replace him than Eboracus, who has been accustomed to
          the stormy seas of Britain, and whose nerves are of
          iron.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed, the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gubernator</span></span> or helmsman had hard
          work for his arms. The two enormous paddles had short cross-pieces
          let into them, like the handles of a scythe, and the clumsy and
          heavy mechanism for giving direction to the head of the vessel was
          worked by leverage in this manner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sailors
          managed everything on deck, the cordage, the anchors, the sail and
          the boats. In rough weather they undergirded the ship; that is to
          say, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name=
          "Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>passed horizontal
          cords round her to brace the spars together so as to facilitate
          resistance to the strain when laboring against the waves. The
          sailors were under the direction of the captain or trierarch, so
          called whether he commanded a trireme or a Liburnian of two
          benches.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On deck the
          steersman occupied a sort of sentry-box in the stern, and beside
          him sat the mate, the second mate, and often also the captain,
          forming a sort of council for the direction of the vessel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a
          favorite figure in the early Church to represent the Bishop as the
          helmsman of the sacred vessel, and the presbyters who sat about him
          as the mates occupying the stern bench. As already said, in a Roman
          vessel, there was a lack of that unity in direction under the
          captain to which we are accustomed. A military officer was always
          supreme everywhere on sea as on land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the sailors
          were engaged in sailing, then the rowers rested or caroused, and
          when they in turn bowed over the oars, the sailors had leisure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun went
          down in the west, lighting up the sky above where he set with a
          rainbow or halo of copper light fading into green.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night fell
          rapidly, and the stars looked out above and around, and formed
          broken reflections in the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In winter the
          foam that broke and was swept to right and left had none of the
          flash and luminosity it displayed in summer, when the water was
          warm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Already in the
          wake the Greek isles and mountain ridges had faded into night.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The oars dipped
          evenly, and the vessel sped for<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ward at a speed equal to that of a modern
          Channel steamer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a signal from
          Lamia the mourners on the quarter-deck ceased to intone their
          wail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He and Domitia
          stood in the bows and looked directly before them. They could see a
          large vessel ahead, of three banks of oars, but she floated
          immovable on the gently heaving, glassy sea. The oars were all
          shipped and she was making no way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deck
          sparkled with lights. Torches threw up red flames, lamps gave out a
          fainter yellow gleam. To the cordage lights had been suspended, and
          braziers burning on the quarter-deck, fed with aromatic woods,
          turned the water around to molten fire, and sent wafts of fragrance
          over the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The twang of a
          lyre and the chirp of a feeble voice were faintly audible; and
          then, after a lull, ensued a musical shout of applause in rhythmic
          note.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is the Augustus singing,”</span> said Lamia in a
          tone of smothered rage and mortification. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And he has his band of adulators about
          him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But why do not the rowers urge on the vessel?”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          committing high treason in drowning the song of the princely

          and the plash in the water would drown even his most supreme
          trills.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia leaned
          over the side of the vessel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius Lamia
          started, and looked at the girl.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She laid her

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were now
          left on deck only Lamia, Domitia, the steersman, Eboracus, one
          sailor and the physician, who was leaning over the bulwarks looking
          north at the glittering constellation of Cassiopea’s Chair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was near the
          quarter-deck, in the fore part of the vessel, and had been
          unobserved in the darkness by Lamia and Domitia, till they returned
          aft.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the young
          man started as he observed him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was it possible
          that the man had overheard the words spoken? There was nothing in
          the attitude or manner of the physician to show that he entertained
          alarm. Lamia resolved on keeping an eye upon him that he did not
          communicate with the crew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luke returned
          aft when the young people came in that direction, and seated
          himself quietly on a bench.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus was
          rapidly communicated with and gained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Artemis flew
          forward, noiselessly, save for the plunge of the oars and the hiss
          of the foam, as it rushed by like milk, and from the hold sounded
          the muffled note of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">symphonicius</span></span> or piper.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every moment the
          vessel neared the imperial galley, and sounds of revelry became
          audible. Nothing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg
          59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>showed that any on board were aware of the
          approach of a Liburnian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was now seen
          that tables were spread on the deck of the Imperial vessel, and
          that the prince and his attendants, and indeed the entire crew were
          engaged in revelry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between the
          courses which were served, Nero ascended the quarter-deck, and sang
          or else delivered a recitation from a Greek tragedian, or a piece
          of his own composition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the approach
          of the bireme was observed, which did not seem to be the case, it
          caused no uneasiness. The Emperor’s vessel had been accompanied by
          a convoy, but the ships had been dispersed by the storm; and the
          bireme, if perceived, was doubtless held to be one of the
          fleet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Helios,
          the confidant of Nero, had ascended the quarter-deck to his master,
          and began to declaim the speech of the attendant in the Electra
          descriptive of the conquests of Orestes—applying the words, by
          significant indications to the prince returning a victor from the
          Grecian games.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He, having come to the glorious pageantry of the
          sports in Greece, entered the lists to win the Delphic prizes, he,
          the admired of every eye. And having started from his goal in
          wondrous whirls he sped along the course, and bore away the of all
          coveted prize of victory. But that I may tell thee in few words
          amidst superfluity I have never known such a man of might and deeds
          as he—”</span> and he bowed and waved his hands towards Nero.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A roar of
          applause broke out, interrupted by a cry from Nero who suddenly
          beheld a dark ship plunge <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg
          60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>out
          of the night and come within the radiance of the lights on board
          his vessel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile, on
          the Artemis, with set face sat Eboracus, guiding the head of the
          Liburnian as directed. He could see the twinkling lights, and hear
          the sounds of rejoicing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Slack speed,”</span> called Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Slack your oars,”</span> down into the hold.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          pause—all oars held poised for a moment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Double!”</span> shouted Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Double your oars!”</span> down the ladder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly the
          water hissed about the bows, and the oars plunged.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus by a
          violent movement threw himself and his entire weight on the handle
          of one paddle, so as to turn the bireme about, and ram her midships
          into the Imperial trireme, when suddenly, without a word, Luke had
          drawn a knife through the thong that restrained the paddle, and
          instantly the <span lang="grc" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "grc"><span style="font-style: italic">pedalion</span></span>
          leaped out of place, and would have gone overboard, had not the
          physician caught and retained it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately the
          direction of the Artemis was altered and in place of running into
          the trireme, she swerved and swung past the Imperial galley without
          touching her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero, white with
          alarm and rage shrieked from the quarter-deck,</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who commands?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then to those by
          him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pour oil on the flames.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At once from the
          braziers, tongues of brilliant light leaped high into the air.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The name!”</span> yelled the furious
          prince.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
          reply:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cnæus Domitius Corbulo.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And by the glare
          he saw, standing by the mast, distinct against the darkness of the
          night behind, the form of a man—and the face was the face of the
          murdered general.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero staggered
          back—and would have fallen unless caught by Helios.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The dead pursue me,”</span> he gasped. <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is well done,”</span> said Eboracus in an undertone
          to the physician; <span class="tei tei-q">“Otherwise there had been
          the cross for you and me. The thong broke.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I severed it,”</span> said Luke.</p>

          even to the risk of the cross. Did’st see the noble Lamia, how
          ready he was? He assumed the mask of my dead master and we have
          slipped by and sent a shiver through the whole company of the
          Trireme, and the August too, I trow,—for they have thought us the
          Ship of the Dead.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a pause he
          said,—<span class="tei tei-q">“In my home we hold that all souls go
          to sea in a phantom vessel; and sail away to the West, to the Isles
          of the Blessed. At night a dark ship with a sail as a thundercloud
          comes to the shore, and those near can hear the dead in trains go
          over the beach and enter the ghostly vessel, till she is laden, and
          then she departs.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Artemis made
          her way without disaster to Rhegium, and thence coasted up Italy to
          the port of Rome. She had gained on the Imperial vessel, that was
          delayed at Brundusium to collect the scattered fleet. Nero would
          not land until he reached Neapolis, and then not till all his
          wreaths and golden apples, as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>well as his entire wardrobe of costumes and
          properties had arrived.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then only did he
          come ashore, and he did so to commence a triumphal progress through
          the Peninsula, the like of which was never seen before nor will be
          seen again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was on the
          19th March, the anniversary of the murder of his mother. On the
          same day a letter was put into his hands announcing the revolt of
          the legions in Gaul and the proclamation of Galba, at that time
          Governor of Spain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So engrossed,
          however, was his mind with preparation for his theatrical
          procession, that he paid no heed to the news, nor was he roused
          till he read the address of Vindex, who led the revolt, denouncing
          him as a <span class="tei tei-q">“miserable fiddler.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This touched him
          to the quick, and he addressed an indignant despatch to the Senate,
          demanding that Vindex should be chastised, and appealed to the
          prizes he had gained as testimony to his musical abilities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So he started
          for Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eighteen hundred
          and eight heralds strutted before him, bearing in their hands the
          crowns that had been awarded him and announcing when and how he had
          succeeded in winning the award.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He entered Rome
          in this leisurely manner, in a triumphal chariot, wearing a purple
          robe, embroidered with gold, an olive garland about his head.
          Beside him a harper struck his instrument and chanted his
          praises.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The houses were
          decorated with festoons, the streets were strewn with saffron;
          singing birds, comfits, flowers were scattered by the people before
          him. If the Sen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg
          64]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ate
          expected that now the prince was in Rome, he would attend to
          business, it was vastly mistaken. His first concern was to arrange
          for a splendid exhibition in which he might gratify the public with
          a finished study of his acting and singing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Solicitude about
          his triumph, his voice, his reception, had so completely filled the
          shallow mind of Nero, that he gave no further thought to the vessel
          that had shot out of the darkness, nearly fouled his galley, and
          which had been apparently commanded by one of his noblest
          victims.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia
          arrived on the Gabian estate, with the corpse of her husband, her
          daughter, Lucius Lamia, and her entire <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“family,”</span> as the company of household slaves was
          termed, without accident and without deter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gabii lay eleven
          miles from Rome at the foot of one of the spurs of the Alban
          mountains. The town stood on a small knoll rising out of the
          Campagna. The stone of which it was built was dark, being a
          volcanic peperino; it was perhaps one of the least attractive sites
          for a country residence, which a Roman noble could have selected;
          but this was not without its advantage, when Emperors acted as did
          Ahab, and cut off those whose villas and vineyards attracted their
          covetous eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A lake occupied
          the crater of an extinct volcano; the water was dark as ink, but
          this was due rather to the character of the bottom, than to depth,
          which was inconsiderable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The villa and
          its gardens lay by the water’s edge. The old city not flourishing,
          but maintaining a languid existence, was famous for nothing but a
          peculiarity in girding the toga adopted by the men, by the
          dingi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name=
          "Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ness of its building
          stone, and by its temple of Juno, an object of pilgrimage when the
          deities of other shrines had proved unwilling or unable to help, a
          sort of pis-aller of devotion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia
          hated the place; it was dull, and she would never have frequented
          it, had it not been the fashion at the period for all people of
          good family to affect a love of retirement into the country, and to
          pretend a taste for simplicity of rural life. Some fine fops had
          their <span class="tei tei-q">“chambers of poverty”</span> to which
          on occasions they retired, to lie on mats upon the ground, and eat
          pulse out of common earthenware. Such periods of self-denial added
          zest to luxury.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia, on the
          other hand, was attached to the place. It was associated with the
          innocent pleasures of earliest childhood. Its spring flowers were
          the loveliest she had ever culled, its June strawberries the most
          delicious she had ever eaten. And the lake teeming with char gave
          opportunities for boating and fishing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here was the
          family burial-place; and here Corbulo was to be burnt, and then his
          ashes collected and consigned to the mausoleum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Messengers had
          been sent forth to invite the attendance of all relations,
          acquaintances and dependents.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The invitation
          was couched, according to unalterable custom, in antiquated terms,
          hardly intelligible. When on the day appointed for the ceremony,
          vast numbers were collected, the funeral procession started.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First went the
          musicians under the conduct of a Master of the Ceremonies. By law,
          the number of <a name="corr065" id="corr065" class=

          was limited to ten.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then followed
          the professional mourners, hired for the occasion from the temple
          of Libitina, the priests <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg

          which were the licensed undertakers. These <a name="corr066" id=
          "corr066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=

          for the purpose of lauding the acts of the deceased and of reciting
          his honors. When they paused at the conclusion of a strophe, horns
          and trumpets brayed. Immediately after the wailers walked a train
          of actors, one of whom was dressed in the insignia of the deceased
          and wore a mask representing him. He endeavored to mimic each
          peculiarity of the man he personated, and buffoons around by their
          antics and jests provoked the spectators to laughter. This farcical
          exhibition was calculated to moderate the excessive grief
          superinduced by the lament of the wailers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
          grand procession of the ancestors, especially dear to the heart of
          the <span class="tei tei-corr">widow.</span> Not only did the
          effigies of the direct forefathers appear, but all related families
          trotted out their ancestors, to attend the illustrious dead, so
          that there cannot have been less than a hundred present.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As already
          mentioned, the wax masks of the dead of a family ornamented every
          nobleman’s hall, usually enclosed in boxes with the titles of the
          defunct inscribed on them in gold characters. These were now
          produced. The mimes were costumed appropriately, as senators,
          generals, magistrates, with their attendants, wearing the wax
          masks, and artificial heads of hair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea
          represented was that of the ancestors having returned from the land
          of Shadows to fetch their descendant and accompany him to the
          nether world. The corpse, that lay on a bier in the hall, was now
          taken up, and carried forth to a loud cry from all in the house of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Vale! Farewell! Fare thee well!”</span>
          Between the lips of the dead man was a coin, placed there as
          payment <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name=
          "Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the toll across
          the River of Death in the ferry-boat of Charon. On each side of the
          bier walked attendants carrying lighted torches. In ancient times
          all funerals had been conducted at night. Now the only reminiscence
          of this custom was in the bearing of lights; but the torches served
          as well a practical purpose, as they were employed to kindle the
          pyre.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the dead
          were carried the insignia of his offices, pictures of the battles
          he had won and statues of the kings and chiefs he had conquered.
          The corpse was followed by a number of manumitted slaves, all
          wearing the cap of liberty, in token of their freedom. Finally came
          the members of the family, friends, retainers, and the sympathizing
          public.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia and
          Domitia Longina walked in their proper place, with dishevelled
          hair, unveiled heads, and in the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ricinium</span></span> or black garment thrown
          over their tunics; the men all wore the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pænula</span></span>, or short travelling
          cloak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
          advanced into the marketplace of Gabii, where Lucius Lamia ascended
          the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">rostrum</span></span> to
          pronounce the funeral oration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately,
          ivory chairs and inlaid stools were ranged in a crescent before
          him, and on these the ancestors seated themselves, the bier being
          placed before them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The panegyric
          was addressed to the crowd outside the circle of mimes with wax
          faces. Lamia had a gift of natural eloquence, his feelings were
          engaged, but his freedom of speech was hampered by necessity of
          caution in allusion to the death of Corbulo, lest some word should
          be let slip which might be caught up and tortured into a
          treasonable reference to Nero.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Laudation
          ended, the entire assembly arose and re-formed in procession to the
          place of burning, which by law must be sixty feet from any
          building. There a pit had been excavated and a grating placed above
          it. On this grating the pyre was erected, consisting of precious
          woods, sprinkled with gums and spices.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this the
          corpse was conveyed. But, previous to its being placed on the
          fagots, a surgeon amputated one of the fingers, which was preserved
          for burial, and then a handful of earth was thrown over the face of
          the deceased.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Anciently the
          Roman dead had been buried, and when the fashion for incineration
          came in, a trace of the earlier usage remained in the burial of a
          member and the covering of the face with soil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now ensued a
          repulsive scene, one without which no great man’s funeral would
          have been considered as properly performed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the
          crowd pushed two small parties of gladiators, three in each, hired
          for the occasion of a company that let them out. Then ensued a
          fight—not mimic, but very real, in front and round the pyre. Now a
          hard-pressed gladiator ran and was pursued, turned sharply and
          hacked at his follower. This was continued till three men had
          fallen and had been stabbed in the breast. Whereupon, the survivors
          sheathed their swords, bowed and withdrew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The torches were
          now put into the hands of Duilia and Domitia, and with averted
          faces they applied the fire to the fagot, and a sheet of flame
          roared up and enveloped the dead man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the
          mourners raised their loudest cries, tore their hair, scarified
          their cheeks with their nails; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>pipes, flutes, horns were blown. In a paroxysm
          of distress, partly real, partly feigned, a rush was made to the
          pyre, and all who got near cast some offering into the
          flames—cakes, flowers, precious stuffs, rings, bracelets, and
          coins.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Duilia, in
          tragic woe, disengaged a mass of artificial hair from her head, and
          cast it into the fire. Then rang out the sacramental
          cry:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">I,
          licet!</span></span> You are permitted to retire,”</span> and
          gladly, sick at heart and faint, Domitia was supported rather than
          walked home.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some hours
          later, when the ashes of the defunct had been collected and
          deposited in an urn, which was conveyed to the mausoleum, Lucius
          Lamia came to the house and inquired for the ladies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was informed
          that the widow was too much overcome by her feelings to see any
          one, but that Domitia was in the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tablinum</span></span> and would receive
          him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He at once
          entered the hall and stepped up into the apartment where she was
          seated, looking pale and worn, with tear-reddened eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She rose, and
          with a sweet sad smile, extended her hand to Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, Domitia,”</span> said he gently, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“as your dear father gave me permission on the wharf at
          Cenchræa, I will claim the same privilege now.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She held her
          cold, tear-stained cheek to him without a word, then returned to
          and sank on her stool.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I thank you, dear friend, and almost brother,”</span>
          she said. <span class="tei tei-q">“You spoke nobly of my father,
          though not more nobly than he deserved. Here, my Lucius, is a
          present for you, I intrust it to you—his sword, which he used so
          gallantly, on which he fell, and still marked with his
          blood.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to an
          Oriental legend, the dominion of Solomon over the spirits resided
          in the power of his staff on which he stayed himself. So long as he
          wielded that, none might disobey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Jins
          sent a white ant up through the floor, that ate out the heart of
          the rod, so that when he leaned on it, it gave way and resolved
          itself into a cloud of fine powder. Solomon fell, and his authority
          was at an end forever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The termites
          that consumed the core of the sceptre of Nero were his own vices
          and follies. Its power was at an end and his fall as sudden as in
          the case of Solomon, and as unexpected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March he was
          possessed of dominion over the world, and was at the head of
          incalculable forces. In June all was dissolved in the dust of
          decay; he was prostrate, helpless, bereft of the shadow of
          authority, unable to command a single slave. The first token of
          what was about to take place was this.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Rome the
          rabble was kept in good humor by the Cæsars distributing among them
          bread gratis, and entertaining them with shows free of charge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
          winter, contrary winds had delayed the corn-ships from Egypt, and
          the amount of bread distributed was accordingly curtailed. Games
          were, in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name=
          "Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>deed, promised, but
          these would serve as condiments to the bread and not as
          substitutes. Then a vessel arrived in port, and the hungry people
          believed that she was laden with the wished-for corn. When,
          however, they learned that her cargo was white sand for strewing
          the arena at the sports, they broke into a storm of discontent and
          swept, howling insulting words, under Nero’s windows.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day all
          Rome heard that Galba, at the head of the legions of Spain and
          Gaul, was marching into Italy, and that none of the troops of Nero
          sent to guard the frontier of the Alps would draw a sword in his
          defence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prince, now
          only seriously alarmed, bade his household guard conduct him to
          Ostia, where he would mount the vessel that had discharged its load
          of sand, and escape to Egypt. They contemptuously refused, and
          disbanded. Then, in an agony of fear, Nero left the Palatine, and
          fled across the river to the Servilian mansion that adjoined the
          racecourse, to light which he had burned Christians swathed in
          tarred wraps.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There he found
          none save his secretary Epaphroditus, whom he had sent there to be
          chained at the door, and to act as porter because he had offended
          him. Guards, freedmen, courtiers, actors, all had taken to their
          heels, but not before they had pillaged the palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He wandered
          about the house, knocking at every door, and nowhere meeting with
          an answer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Night by this
          time had settled in, murk and close, but at intervals electric
          flashes shivered overhead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then suddenly
          the earth reeled, and there passed a sound as of chariot wheels
          rolling heavily through the streets; yet the streets were deserted.
          Trembling, despairing, Nero crouched on his bed, bit his nails till
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072"
          id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he had gnawed them to the
          quick, then started up and hunted for his jewel case. He would fly
          on foot, carrying that, hide in some hovel, till danger was past.
          But a thievish slave had stolen it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sick at heart,
          picking, then biting at his nails, shrinking with apprehension at
          the least noise, wrapping a kerchief about a finger where blood
          came, he looked with dazed eyes at the red flare of the heavenly
          fires pulsating through his open door.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He heard a step
          and ran out, to encounter a freedman, Phaon by name, who was coming
          along the passage, holding aloft a torch, attended by two
          slaves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wretched
          prince clung to him, and entreated that he might not be left alone;
          that Phaon would protect him, and contrive a means of escape.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          assistance at this hour is unavailing. I am but one man, a
          stranger, a Greek, and all Rome, all Italy, the entire world, have
          risen against you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          passed one—Lucius Ælius Lamia,—and he stayed me to inquire where
          you might be found. In his hand he held an unsheathed
          sword.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero shrieked

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sporus came up,
          offering an old moth-eaten cloak. The wardrobe had been plundered,
          only the refuse had been abandoned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A voice was
          heard pealing through the empty corridors: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Horses! horses at the door!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Epaphroditus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the entrance,
          chained to a cumbrous log, was the Greek, Epaphroditus, formerly a
          pampered favorite. But two days previously he had ventured to
          correct a false quantity in some verses by his master, and Nero, in
          a burst of resentment and mortified vanity, had ordered him to be
          fastened to a beam as doorkeeper to the Servilian Palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“May it please my lord to mount. Sporus and
          the slaves can run afoot.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero unwound the
          kerchief from his hand and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg
          75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class=

          broad-brimmed hat over his head, enveloped himself in the blanket
          cloak, and shuffled in his slippers to the door.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chained
          Greek at once cried out: <span class="tei tei-q">“Master! my chain
          has become entangled and is so knotted that I cannot stir. I have
          been thus since noon, and none have regarded me. I pray thee, let
          me go.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          angrily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost think I carry about with me
          the key of thy shackles?”</span> Then to those who followed,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Smite him on the mouth and silence him, or

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mounted on an
          old gray horse, Nero rode to the Ælian Bridge, where stands now
          that of St. Angelo, crossed it and began to traverse the Campus
          Martius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Electric flashes
          quivered across the sky. Then again an earthquake made the city
          rock as if drunk; the buildings were rent, and masses of cornice
          fell down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A glare of white
          lightning illumined the whole field and lighted up the mausoleum of
          Augustus, and the blank faces of such men as were abroad.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horse
          trembled and refused to move. It was some time before the alarm of
          the brute could be allayed, and it could be coaxed to go forward
          and begin the ascent of the Quirinal. The advance was slow; and
          Nero’s fears became greater as the road <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>approached the Prætorian Camp, and he expected
          recognition by the sentinels. Yet in the midst of his fear wild
          flashes of hope shot, and he said to Phaon:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What think you, if I were to enter the camp? Surely
          the Prætorians would rally about me, and I might dissolve the
          Senate.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sire, they have destroyed your images, and have
          proclaimed Galba. They would take off your head and set it on a
          pike.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero uttered a
          groan, and kicked the flanks of his steed. At that moment a
          passer-by saluted him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the Immortals! I am recognized.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have but to go a little further.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Phaon, what if the Senate declare me an enemy of the
          State?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then you will fare in the customary
          manner.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How is that?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prince put
          his trembling hand to his brow and in his agitation knocked off his
          hat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The freedman
          picked it up.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The customary manner, sire! your neck will be put in
          the cleft of a forked stick and you will be beaten, lashed, kicked
          to death. Better take the sword and fall on it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, Phaon! not yet! I cannot endure pain. I have a
          spring nail now—and it hurts! it hurts!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ride on, my lord; at the cypress hedge we will turn
          our horses loose, and by a path through the fields reach my
          villa.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Half an hour
          after Nero had left the Servilian palace, where now stands the
          Lateran, Lamia arrived followed by two servants. He found the
          secretary in a heap at the door, vainly writhing in his knotted
          chains. Lamia <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg
          77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at
          once asked him about the prince, whether he was there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will both answer and show you whither he is
          fled,”</span> said Epaphroditus, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you
          will release me. Otherwise my tongue is tied like my
          limbs.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Is he here?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, he has been here, but is gone. Whither I alone
          can say. The price of the information is release.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tell me where I can find tools.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Epaphroditus
          gave the required information and Lamia despatched a servant to
          bring hammer and chisel. They were speedily produced; but some time
          was taken up in cutting through the links.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, however,
          was finally effected, and the secretary gathered up a handful of
          the broken chain and clenched it in his fist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now I will lead the way,”</span> said he, stretching
          himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wretched,
          fallen emperor had in the meanwhile scrambled through hedges and
          waded through a marsh, and had at last found a temporary shelter in
          a garden tool-house of the villa. Phaon feared to introduce him
          into his house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wearied out, he
          cast himself on a sort of bier on which the gardeners carried
          citron trees to and from the conservatory. The cloak had fallen
          from him and lay on the soil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His feet were
          muddy and bleeding. He had tried to eat some oat-cake that had been
          offered him, but was unable to swallow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He continued to
          be teased with, and to pick or bite at his spring nails.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I hear steps!”</span> he cried. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They will kill me!”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sire, play the man.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Phaon offered
          him a couple of poniards.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero put the
          point of one to his breast, shrunk and threw it away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is too blunt, it will not enter,”</span> he
          said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He tried the
          other and dropped it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is over sharp. It cuts,”</span> he said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that moment
          the door opened and Lamia and Epaphroditus entered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero cried out
          and covered his face:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sporus! Phaon! one or both! kill yourselves and show
          me how to do it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To do it!”</span> said Lamia sternly. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That is not difficult. Do you need a sword? Here is
          one—the sword of Corbulo.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He extended the
          weapon to the prince, who accepted it with tremulous hand, looking
          at Lamia with glassy eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh! a moment! I feel sick.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Phaon said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sire—at once!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Nero, with
          all power going out of his fingers, pointed the blade to his
          throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I cannot,”</span> he gasped, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my hand is numb.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately,
          Epaphroditus with his hand full of chain, brought the weighted fist
          against the haft, and drove the sword into the coward’s throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He sank back on
          the bier.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lamia
          stooped, gathered up the moth-eaten cloak, and threw it over the
          face of the dying man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          proclamation of emperors, cutting of throats, that I, poor thing,

          on the Artemis, when I asked you a question, and then you were
          forced to admit that all your science was built up on conjecture,
          and that there was no certainty underlying it. But a guess is
          better than nothing, and a guess that carries the moral sense with
          it in approval, may come near to the truth. I recall all you then

          lie-abed, and a sot. He let his servants do as they liked, make
          love, quarrel, fight, the one lord it over the other, and all idle,
          because on none was imposed any duty. It was a villainous
          household, and the estate went to the hammer. It seems to me,
          Euphrosyne, as if this whole world were the estate of Lentulus on a
          large scale, where all the servants squabbled, and one by sheer
          force tyrannizes over the others, and none know why they are placed
          there, and what is their master’s will, and what they have to do.
          There is no day-table of work. There is either no master over such

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia did not
          go into the house, as desired, to receive Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was well
          aware that he would come to her into the garden, if she did not
          present herself within, and she preferred to speak with him away
          from her mother.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She therefore
          continued to walk under the vines. She looked up at the sunlight
          filtering through the broad green flaky shade, with here and there
          a ray kissing a purple, pendent bunch of grapes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she looked
          at the dreaming peacock, the sun flashing on its metallic
          plumage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No! matter was
          not evil. Matter, indeed, without life was not even like the
          statue—for that was a copy of what lived, and failed just in this,
          that it fell short of life. Domitia felt as though she were
          touching the edge of a great verity, but had not set her foot upon
          it. Then she considered what Euphrosyne had said to her, and she to
          her slave. Wherever the path of duty lay, there violets bloomed and
          verbena scented the air. Was not life itself, devoid of the
          knowledge of its purport, and its obligations and its destiny, like
          matter uninformed by Life? Or if any life entered into it, it was
          the disintegrating life of decay and decomposition?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She, for her
          part, had no obligations laid on her. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          at once duties would spring up, and her way would be rosy. Till
          then her happiness hung in suspense, like that of her mother,
          during the period of widowhood in which she was expected and
          required to live in retirement. Out of society, not elbowing and
          shouldering her way forward—that was a year of blank and of
          unhappiness to Longa Duilia, in which she found no consolation save
          in badgering her steward, and in scheming for the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia, as
          Domitia expected he would, came to her under the trellis, and she
          received him with that dimple in her cheek which gave her
          expression so much sweetness mingled with pathos,</p>

          who will be up to-morrow, and which down. Galba is dead, almost
          torn to pieces by those who worshipped him yesterday. Otho is
          proclaimed by the Senate. Yet there is fresh trouble brewing and
          threats sound from the provinces. Methinks every general at the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the girl
          went up to him, with a pretty, winning smile, and said:</p>

          too weighty to be dismissed at once; they take time to digest.
          There is one thing you may do for me, that I desire of you
          heartily, and in which I will not controvert your authority. It is
          said that the stars rule the destinies of men, and that in the far
          East, on the boundless plains of Mesopotamia, you and your people
          have learned to read them. I would fain know what the heavens have
          in store for me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          gladly undertake, but it cannot be done hastily. It will require
          time. There are, however, other ways of reading the future than by
          the stars. There is Ishtar, whom the Egyptians call Isis, whom thou

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          The goddess has her chosen instrument, and such is Helena. Lady!
          Ishtar is the Truth, she has no image. She is invisible to us
          veiled in matter. She hides herself behind seven veils, or rather
          our eyes are so wrapped about that we cannot see her who is visible
          only in spirit. Thou knowest that in the Temple floor is a rent,
          and through that rent the breath of the gods ascends. I will place
          Helena over that rent, and she will fall into a trance, and if I
          say certain prayers and use certain invocations, then the veils
          will fall away, and in pure spiritual essence she will look into
          the face of Ishtar and read therein the Truth, past, present, and
          future. Is it your pleasure to consult the goddess?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl and
          Lucius Lamia had been so much together in Syria, that they had come
          to regard each other with the affection of brother and sister. In
          Greek life the females occupied a separate portion of the house to
          the males, and did not partake of meals with them. There was no
          common family life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Old Roman
          domestic arrangements had been very different from this. There the
          wife and mother occupied a place of dignity, with her daughters
          around her, and sat and span in the atrium, where also the men
          assembled. She prepared the meals, and partook of them with her
          husband, and the sisters with their brothers. The only difference
          between them at table was that the men reclined to eat, whereas the
          women sat on stools. But this home life, which had been so
          wholesome and so happy, in the luxury and wealth of the age at the
          fall of the Commonwealth and the rise <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>of Imperialism, had become an element of
          demoralization. For the conversation of the men had grown
          shameless, the exhibitions at banquets of coarse drunkenness, and
          of dancing girls, and the singing of ribald songs by musicians, had
          driven away shame from the cheeks of the women, and corrupted the
          freshness of the children’s innocence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet there were,
          through even the worst periods, households in which the healthy old
          Roman simplicity and familiarity between the sexes remained, good
          fathers and mothers who screened their children’s eyes from evil
          sights, devoted husbands and wives full of mutual reverence. Such
          had been the house of Corbulo, whether in Rome, or in Syria. He had
          been a strict and honorable soldier, and a strict and honorable
          father in his family.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it was that
          Lucius Lamia, and Domitia had seen much of each other, and that
          affection for each other mingled with respect had grown up
          naturally and vigorously in their hearts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Lucius
          was paddling on the glassy tarn. He used but little action.
          Occasionally he dipped the paddles, then allowed the skiff to glide
          forward till she ceased to be moving, when again he propelled her
          with one stroke. He was musing; so also was Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All at once he
          roused himself.</p>

          cannot return from the dead. And yet—there be strange rumors. Among
          the Christians, I am told, there has risen up a seer, who hath been
          taken with an ecstasy, and hath beheld wonderful visions. And this
          is reported, that he saw a beast arising out of the sea, having
          seven heads, and on each head a golden crown. And one of those
          heads, the fifth, received a death-wound. Then arose two other
          heads, and after them the wounded head arose once again and
          breathed fire and slaughter, and the second state was worse than
          the first.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But, Lucius, what can this signify?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They say it signifies the Empire of Rome, and that the

          death, but not slain, is Nero, and that after two have arisen, then
          he will return.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius and
          Domitia stepped out of the boat; he moored it to the side, and they
          walked together to the little temple. This was not one to which a
          college of priests was attached, nor even an ædiculum, with a
          guardian who had charge of it, to open it on special festivals; it
          had been erected by the father of Corbulo in deference to the wish
          of his wife, who had taken it into her head to become a votary of
          Isis, this having become a fashionable cult. But on her death the
          doors had been closed, and it had fallen into neglect, till the
          return of Longa Duilia from the East with the Chaldee Magus from
          Antioch. It was now fashionable to dabble in sorcery, and a
          distinguished lady liked to be able to talk of her Magus, to seek
          his advice, and, at table, air a superficial familiarity with the
          stars, and the Powers and Æons, the endless genealogies of
          emanations from the primæval and eternal Light.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa had
          engaged the Magus when at Antioch, but when somewhat summarily sent
          to Europe by her husband, she had not taken her Chaldæan magician
          with her. As, however, she had no wish to appear in Rome without
          him, she had laid it on her husband when he returned to bring the
          man with him, and if he did not return himself, to despatch the
          Magus to her.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg
          97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On her arrival
          in the villa at Gabii, she had given up the temple of Isis to
          Elymas, and he had converted it into a place for study.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the door
          hung a heavy curtain, and this Lamia raised to allow Domitia to
          pass within. The interior would have been wholly dark, but that a
          brazier with glowing charcoal stood within, and into the fire the
          magician threw gums, that flamed up and diffused a fragrant
          smoke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the flicker
          Domitia observed that a bed was laid above a small fissure in the
          marble floor—a rent caused by earthquake—through which vapor of an
          intoxicating nature issued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this bed lay
          a woman, or rather a figure that Domitia took to be that of a
          woman, but it was covered with much drapery that concealed face and
          hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The brazier was
          near the head, and by it stood Elymas in a tall headdress, with
          horns affixed, that met in front. He wore a black garment reaching
          to the feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the darkness
          nothing could be seen save his erect figure, and face shining out
          like a lamp, when he cast resinous drops on the fire, and the
          motionless couched form of the woman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia,
          somewhat frightened, put her hand on the arm of Lamia, to make sure
          that he was present and could assist her, should need for
          assistance arise;—that is to say, should her courage fail, or the
          visions she expected to see prove too alarming.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the Magus
          said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As I have told thee, lady, out of the ineffable Light
          stream rays that are both luminous and life-producing. These rays
          penetrate to the lowest profundity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>matter, and as they pass through the higher
          atmospheres, gather about them the particles of vapor, and become
          angels and demons. But other rays passing further down, and
          assuming grosser envelopes, become men and women, some more animal
          than others, some with higher spiritual natures than the rest,
          according as in them matter or spirit dominates. And the rays
          darting into further depths become the beasts of the field, the
          fishes of the sea, even the very worm that bores in the soil. As
          thou knowest, he who stands on a high mountain can see far horizons
          to right and to left as well as the objects below him. So, to the
          Eternal, all is visible, the past on one side, the present before
          Him, and the future on the other side, all in one vision. To Him
          there is no past, and no present, and no future, for Time is
          not—all is comprehended in one view. But we, who are below, see
          only the present, remember the past, and conjecture what is future.
          If we would see future as well as past, we must rise above matter,
          mount from our base level to the altitude of spirit. Thence all is
          clear. But this is not possible to all, only to those elect ones in
          whom the flesh is subdued, and to it the spirit remains attached
          only by a fibre. Such is Helena. Through her thou shalt see what
          thou desirest. Now behold!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He pointed into
          the darkness before him, and both Domitia and Lucius saw a spark
          that grew in intensity and shone like a star.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That,”</span> said Elymas, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
          a crystal. It is the lens through which the rays of the Eternal and
          Immortal Light pass to the soul of Helena, out of Infinite Altitude
          and Illimitable Space. She is enveloped in seven veils. Now she
          lieth in a trance, and seeth naught. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>But I will invoke this Fount of Life and Light
          and Knowledge, and will gather the rays together into her soul
          through yonder crystal, and she will see in vision what thou
          desirest. Seven veils cover her, and seven are the revelations that
          will be made. I cannot assure thee that all will be future—some may
          be scenes of the past, for to the All-Seeing, the Eye of Eternity,
          there is neither past nor future; all is present.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, so be it,”</span> said Lamia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the past we can judge the future. Let us see things
          that have been and we can form some notion of what is shown us as
          future. If the one be incorrect, then the other is
          untrustworthy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou shalt behold nothing,”</span> said the Magus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“for it is not thou who consultest me, but
          the lady Domitia Longina.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How shall I see, and not he who stands beside
          me?”</span> asked the girl. Her heart fluttered with
          apprehension.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sorcerer
          stooped, and drew from under the covering the right hand of the
          prostrate woman, and bade Domitia hold it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She took the
          hand in hers; it was stiff and cold as that of a corpse, and she
          shuddered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hold her hand in thine,”</span> said Elymas,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and I will invoke the Source of Spirits,
          and as I withdraw each veil that covers her face, she will see
          something, and she seeing it, the sense of sight will pass through
          her hand to thee, and thou wilt see also, inwardly, yet very
          really. Only let not go her hand, or all will become
          dark.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he went
          before the crystal, that stood on an altar like a truncated column;
          and he uttered words rapidly in a strange tongue, then turned,
          threw a hand<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
          100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ful of spices upon the coals, and a dense
          aromatic smoke filled the interior. It dissipated, and Domitia
          uttered a faint <span class="tei tei-corr">cry.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What ails thee?”</span> asked Lucius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thinking she was
          frightened, he added—<span class="tei tei-q">“Let us go forth. This
          is mere jugglery.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But I see,”</span> she said in tremulous tones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What dost thou see?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Lucius! It is the garden at Cenchræa—and my father!
          O, my father!”</span> she sobbed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One veil had
          been withdrawn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Enough,”</span> said Lucius. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I think naught of this: every one is aware how the
          noble Cnæus Corbulo came by his death.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then see again,”</span> said the Magus. He took hold
          of a second veil that covered the prostrate woman, drew it off, and
          let it fall on the ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius felt the
          left hand of Domitia contract suddenly on his arm. He looked before
          him, but saw nothing save the crystal, in which moved lights. It
          was iridescent as an opal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          exclaimed:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It was he! the physician Luke—who cut the thong. But
          for him, we should have run down the Imperial trireme. He did
          it!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What mean you?”</span> asked the young man in
          surprise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lucius, I see it all—the sea, the vessel on which is
          Nero carousing;—ourselves—we are running at her. And he has cut the
          thong, the paddle flies up, and our course is altered.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the Magus
          uttered a few words, and withdrew the third veil.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man
          heard his companion breathing heavily; but she said nothing. He
          waited awhile and then, stooping to her, asked:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Seest thou aught?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> she answered in a whisper. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yet not with my bodily eyes, I know not how—but I
          see—”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The end of Nero. Now thou hast thrown the mantle over
          his face—enough!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Elymas
          turned and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hitherto thou hast beheld that which is past.
          Sufficeth it? or wilt thou even look into that which is to
          be?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It sufficeth,”</span> said Lucius, and would have
          drawn his companion away. But she held to the hand of the woman on
          the bed, and said firmly:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, my friend. Now I have seen things that are past, I
          will even look into the future. It was for this I came
          hither.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now again
          did the magician utter prayers, and wave his hands. Thereupon
          strange lights and changes appeared in the crystal, and it seemed
          of milky moonlight hue, yet with shoots as of lightning traversing
          it. All at once the Magus took off the fourth veil and cast it on
          the marble floor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius remained
          motionless, looking at the changing light in the crystal, and
          feeling the nervous hand of Domitia twitching on his arm. He
          thought that he heard her laugh, but almost immediately with a cry,
          she loosed her hand from the unconscious woman on the couch, threw
          her arms round the neck of Lamia, and sank sobbing on his
          breast.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was some time
          before she was sufficiently re<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>covered to speak, and then was reluctant to
          disclose what she had seen. Lucius, however, urged her with gentle
          persuasion, and, clinging to him, between sobs, in whispers she
          confided:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, Lucius! I thought—I—I saw that the day had come
          when you and I—Lucius, when I went to your house and was lifted
          across the threshold, and then, as I stretched my hands to you and
          took yours—then, all at once, a red face came up behind—whence I
          know not—and two long hands thrust us apart. Then I let go—I let
          go—and—and I saw no more.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When that day comes, my Domitia, no hands shall divide

          enough.”</span></p>

          "tei tei-q">“Nay, I will look to the end.”</span> She took the hand
          of Helena, into which some flexibility and warmth were
          returning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Art thou willing?”</span> asked the Magus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She nodded, and
          the fifth veil fell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For full five
          minutes Domitia stood rigid, without moving a muscle, hardly
          breathing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lucius
          said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“See what a purple light shines out of the crystal.

          be right royal.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is royal,”</span> she said in faint tones.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Lucius! what that Christian prophet spoke,
          that have I also seen—the beast with seven heads, one wounded to
          the death, and there cometh up another out of the deadly wound,
          and—it hath the red face I saw but just now. And it climbeth to a
          throne and lifteth me up to sit thereon. Away with the vision. It
          offendeth me. It maketh my blood turn ice
          cold!”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hast thou a desire to see further?”</span> asked the
          Magus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I can see naught worse than this,”</span> said
          Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shudder ran
          through her, and her teeth chattered as with frost.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Elymas
          again waved his hands, and chanted, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Askion, Kataskion, lix, Tetras, damnameneus,”</span>
          and raised and cast down the sixth veil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At once from the
          crystal a red light shone forth, and suffused the whole cell of the
          temple with a blood-colored illumination, and by it Lucius could
          see that there was in it no image present, only a dense black veil
          behind the altar on which the stone glowed like a carbuncle. He
          heard the breath pass through the teeth of Domitia, like the
          hissing of a serpent. He looked at her, her face was terrible,
          inflamed. The eyes stiffened, the teeth were set, the brow knitted
          and lowering. Then she said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I stand on the beast, and the sword of my father
          pierces his heart.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius wondered;
          there was a look of hate, a hideousness in her face, such as he had
          not conceived it possible so beautiful and sweet a countenance
          could have assumed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Elymas cast
          off the last veil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment all
          was darkness. The red light in the crystal had expired. In
          stillness and suspense, not without fear, all waited, all standing
          save Helena, who had recovered from her trance, and she paused
          expectant on her couch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then a minute
          spark appeared in the crystal, of the purest white light, that
          grew, rapidly sending out wave on wave of brilliance, so intense,
          so splendid, so daz<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
          104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=

          effulgence, turned and threw himself into a corner, and wrapped his
          head about with his mantle. And the medium turned with a cry, as
          though the light caused her physical pain, buried her face in the
          pillow, and groped on the floor for the veils to cast over her head
          to exclude the light.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius, unable
          to endure the splendor, covered his eyes with his palm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Domitia
          looked at it, and her face grew soft, the scowl went from her brow,
          and a wondrous tenderness and sorrow came into her eyes; great
          tears rose and rolled down her cheeks, and glittered like diamonds
          in the dazzling beam.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she said
          with a sob:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          Felicitas.</span></span>”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly an
          explosion. The orb was shattered into a thousand sparks, and all
          was black again in the temple—black as deepest night.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lucius
          caught Domitia to him, put his hand behind him, drew back the
          curtain, and carried her forth into the calm evening air, and the
          light of the aurora hanging over the setting sun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She sobbed,
          gradually recovered herself, drew a profound sigh, and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Duilia was in an easy-chair, and a slave-girl, Lucilla, was engaged

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Summer was over,

          the hot air carried through every wall.</p>

          like a sea-horse, breathe more evenly and equably;—Plancus, you are
          becoming unendurable. I must not consider my bereaved feelings, but
          her welfare, her health. The air or the situation of Gabii does not
          suit her. Rome is an extraordinarily healthy place in winter. I
          myself am never better anywhere than I am there. I was pretty well
          at Antioch; there were military there, and I find the soil and
          climate salubrious where there are military. Plancus?—as the Gods
          love me, you have been in the stables. I know it by infallible
          proofs. Stand at a distance, I insist. And, Plancus! you are not
          showing off conjuring tricks, that you should fold and unfold your
          hands. You go to Rome and take such of the family with you as are
          necessary. I am not going to be mewed up here any longer, because
          my two years of widowhood are not over. You are making faces at me,

          decide. His father was a pottering sort of a man, an auctioneer,
          and commissioner of drains and dirt and all that sort of thing. A
          worthy fellow, I dare say; I believe he had a statue erected to him
          somewhere because he did the scavengering so well. He married above
          his position, one Vespasia Polla; I have seen and heard of her, a
          round-faced woman like a pudding; he took her for her blood, but
          she was only a knight’s daughter; and those city knights, as the
          Gods love me! what a money-grubbing low set they are! His son,
          Flavius Vespasianus is proclaimed! It is really funny. It is, O
          Morals! I must laugh. Now, if my good man had but listened to me.
          But there, I shall become mad.—I don’t know how long it is since
          you have been pecking, or whether you eat all day long? But you
          have crumbs sticking in your beard. Another time be good enough to
          comb your beard before approaching me. Tell me, what has given
          Domitia the dumps?”</span></p>

          must go to Rome. Positively two years retirement for a widow is

          though of course we all talk about Liberty and Cato, and all that

          Sabinus is præfect of the city, and he is the elder brother of
          Vespasian. I might show him some little inconspicuous
          civilities—give a little cosy, quiet supper. By the way—yes, he is
          married to an old hunks, I remember. Oh! if his brother gets to the
          top, he can divorce her. Yes, positively I shall not be able to
          breathe till I get back to Rome. By the way, draw me up on a couple

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia and
          her entire household had returned to the capital, and were
          installed in the family mansion in the Carinæ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Happily, as
          Corbulo had considered it, this house had escaped in the
          conflagration of Rome under Nero. This, however, was a matter of
          some regret to Duilia, who would have preferred to have had it
          burnt, so that it might have been rebuilt in greater splendor and
          in newer style.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          although externally dingy, it was a commodious mansion within, and
          was well furnished, especially with carpets and curtains of
          Oriental texture, that had been wrought at, or purchased at the
          bazaars of Antioch and Damascus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The centre of
          the house was occupied by the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atrium</span></span>, or hall, open to the sky
          above the water tank in the midst. On each side at the further end
          from the entrance extended the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wings”</span> that contained the family portraits
          enclosed in gilded boxes or shrines, the doors of which were thrown
          open on festal occasions. In the centre, between the wings was the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tablinum</span></span>, the reception-room of
          the house, and on the right side of the entrance was the family
          money-chest, girded with iron.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the ledge of
          the water tank before the reception room, smoked a little altar
          before an image of Larpater, the ancestor and founder of the
          family, regarded as the tutelary deity of the house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">penates</span></span>, the subsidiary
          household gods, that had formerly been retained in the hall, near
          the altar—curious, smoked, and badly-shaped dolls, some in rags,
          some in wood, others in terra cotta—were sometimes consigned to a
          family chapel, but in the house of the widow of Corbulo, as in many
          another, they had been relegated to a shelf in the kitchen near the
          hearth, and a lamp was maintained perpetually burning before
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In primitive
          times, when life was simple, the hall had been the common room of
          the house, in which the wife cooked the meals at the hearth, and
          where also on seats, father, wife, children and domestics partook
          together of the common meal. But now all this was altered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In winter the
          hall was too cold to be sat in. It was inconvenient to have the
          cooking done before all eyes. Consequently a separate kitchen and
          separate dining-rooms were constructed, and the smoking altar and
          the image by it alone remained in the hall as a reminiscence of the
          family hearth that once stood there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is more
          difficult to understand the meals and meal times of the old Romans,
          than the arrangement of their houses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They rose vastly
          early in the morning, and took a snack of breakfast of the simplest
          description, which lasted them till lunch at 10 a. m. But such as
          were occupied abroad rarely returned home for this meal. At noon
          they bathed, and then came the great feed of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114"

          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cœna</span></span>, which we translate
          <span class="tei tei-q">“supper,”</span> but which was begun at
          half-past one in winter and an hour later in summer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This lasted the
          entire afternoon, and even on great occasions into the night. Some
          revellers did not break up till midnight, or even prolonged the
          orgy to dawn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not till
          the Goths and Vandals overflowed the classic world, that the supper
          was postponed until the evening.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
          citizen’s day was from dawn till noon. Then he had his snooze and
          his bath, and the remainder of the day was devoted to the mighty
          meal and to reading, conversation, and amusement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am so pleased to see you,”</span> said Longa Duilia,
          stepping forward to receive the Præfect of Rome, to her little

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was a
          gray-headed, plain, blunt man, with very ordinary features; he was

          cousin. Give me your hand, Flavius. The table calls us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house of a
          wealthy Roman at this period had not only a summer dining-room,
          open to the air, but one also for winter, well heated by stoves.
          Three tables were placed, so as to accommodate nine persons, three
          at each, leaving the ends of two and an open square in the
          middle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Into this hollow
          the servants ran the <span class="tei tei-q">“repository,”</span> a
          sort of what-not, on wheels, consisting of a tier of shelves, all
          laden with dishes; and the guests put forth their hands and
          selected such meats as they fancied.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Knives they had,
          but no forks. In place of these latter they were furnished with
          spoons, having the extremity of the handle turned down as claw or
          hoof, or sharpened to a point, so as to serve to hold the meat
          whilst it was being cut. When so employed, the bowl of the spoon
          was held in the hollow of the hand; but when used as a spoon, then
          the end was reversed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sideboard was
          piled up with silver and gold plate. In addition in a corner stood
          a round table with three feet; on which were laid napkins neatly
          tied up with blue and red bands. These napkins contained trinkets,
          rings, brooches, comfits, mottoes, and were to be given to the
          guests along with the dessert. Our presentation of Christmas
          crackers is a reminiscence of the old Roman custom of making
          presents to the guests at the close of a banquet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The males lay at
          table on couches, with their legs extended behind them, their left
          elbows reposed on pillows. It was against ancient Roman custom for
          ladies to recline, but recently some empresses had <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>broken through the rule, and when they
          set the example of lounging, others followed. Duilia, however, was
          a stickler in some things, and she somewhat affected archaic
          usages, as a mark of distinction, as a token of the antiquity of
          the family, whose customs had acquired an almost sacred sanction.
          Ladies sat on stools.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The couches and
          seats were sumptuous, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell
          and silver, and were covered with Oriental carpets.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every guest was
          attended by a slave, bearing an ewer and napkin, so that he might
          cleanse his fingers directly they became greasy—a necessity of
          constant recurrence, on account of the absence of proper forks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A baldachin of
          embroidered silk was stretched above the table, and the heads of
          the banqueters. This was done for the purpose of cutting off the
          draught, as immediately above, in the ceiling, was the <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lacunar</span></span>, an opening through
          which the steam and savor of dinner might escape, and through
          which, when the canopy was not spread, rose-leaves, violets, a
          spray of scent, even garlands were scattered over the
          revellers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Roman dinner
          began, like one in Russia at the present day, with a <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gustus</span></span>, a snack of something
          calculated to stimulate the appetite or to help digestion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came in
          soft-boiled eggs, the invariable first dish, just as invariably,
          the meal closed with apples.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the eggs
          were served salads and sauer-kraut, cabbage shredded in vinegar,
          Brussels sprouts boiled with saltpetre to enhance their green,
          turnips and carrots in mustard and vinegar. Melons were eaten with

          mallows and sorrel, olives, mush<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          and were eaten along with large snails, oysters, sardines, and
          chopped lizards.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this was
          preparatory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now entered the
          repository, groaning under meats and fish. At the same moment a
          slave produced and handed round a menu card. But before eating, a
          benediction was pronounced, the household gods were invoked and
          promised a share of the good things from the table.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
          unnecessary to catalogue the solids and <span lang="fr" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">entrées</span></span> sent up at such a
          supper. Pork was a favorite dish, and there were fifty ways in
          which a pig could be served up. Octopus was much relished, as it is
          to this day in Italy. Wild fowl was stuffed with garlic, mutton
          with asafœtida, and some meats were not considered in condition
          till decomposition had begun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strong savor
          produced by those dishes was dissipated by servants holding large
          fans, and counteracted by the diffusion of aromatic smoke, and the
          sprinkling of guests and table with essences.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A supper
          consisted of several courses, but a considerable interval elapsed
          between each, which interval was filled in with conversation, or
          enlivened with the antics of buffoons, or with music, or the
          recitation of poetry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing in the
          smallest degree unseemly was allowed in the house of Longa Duilia,
          at such entertainments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We read a good
          deal, in the ancient authors, of the license allowed at such times,
          but this was not general, certainly was not suffered except in very
          <span class="tei tei-q">“fast”</span> houses, and such were
          attended by none who respected themselves.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The widow knew
          how to make herself agreeable. Flavius Sabinus, the præfect, was a
          great talker, and there was a little rivalry between the two as to
          which should lead the conversation. Domitia hardly spoke, but the
          guests generally entertained themselves heartily.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia was there,
          and near his betrothed, but found it difficult to carry on
          conversation with her. Since the questioning of Ishtar in the
          Temple at Gabii, she had been haunted by the visions presented to
          her inner sight, and she was unable to shake off the oppression of
          spirits and distress of mind, they had caused.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When supper was
          ended, previous to the dessert, all rose, a grace was said, and
          again the household gods were invoked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All were thus
          standing, in solemn hush, whilst a portion for the deities was
          being taken away, when the curtain before the door was roughly
          drawn aside, and a young man ran in—then halted, bewildered by the
          lights and the company, and hesitated before advancing further.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A faint cry
          escaped the breast of Domitia; and she staggered back, and caught
          Lamia convulsively by the wrist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Flavius
          Sabinus said apologetically to his hostess:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This youth is my nephew, Titus Flavius Domitianus, the
          younger son of my brother Vespasian. Pardon his lack of breeding,
          lady—I bade him find me here, if matters of importance demanded my
          attention. Excuse me, I pray, if I retire with him and hear what
          news of weight he bears.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Duilia bowed,
          and the præfect, leaving his place, went to meet his
          nephew.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg
          120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia felt that
          Domitia was trembling. He looked in her face and it alarmed him.
          With wide eyes she was staring at the intruder; her lips were
          slightly parted, every trace of color had deserted them; and
          between them gleamed her teeth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not till the
          curtain had fallen, and hidden the form of the young man, as he
          left with his uncle, did she breathe freer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she heaved
          a long sigh, and said in a faint voice:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is he—the eighth crowned head—the fifth come

          a few evenings ago. It went off quite charmingly, without a hitch.
          I allowed that good Flavius Sabinus to talk; and he is just one of
          those men who enjoys himself best where he is given full flow for
          his twaddle. A good, worthy, commonplace man. I doubt if he has
          push in him, but he is just so situated now that he must go ahead.
          The news is most encouraging. Mucianus is on his way to Italy at
          the head of an army. Primus, with his legions, is approaching; he
          has beaten the troops sent against him, and has sacked Cremona;
          there are positively none who hold by Vitellius except his brother
          in Campania, and his German bodyguard. Domitia,”</span> the widow
          dropped her voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“we can do better than
          with that milksop Ælius Lamia.”</span></p>

          thing, and it is positively wicked to mope indoors when we ought to
          be seen in the streets and the forum. So there, make yourself
          ready. I am going instantly. I have ordered round <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">quite</span></span> a success.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time was now
          that of the Saturnalia, lasting seven days, beginning on the 17th
          December with a strange institution, a banquet of the gods. Usually
          the several gods had their feasts in their own temples and invited
          others to them, but on certain solemn occasions all banqueted
          together in public. The distress, the butcheries, the general
          confusion caused by the setting up and casting down of
          emperors—three in ten months—and now, eight months after, a fourth
          tottering; and every change involving massacre, plunder,
          disturbance of order;—this had moved the priests to decree a solemn
          lectisternium and supplication for the restoration of tranquillity
          and the cessation of civil broil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The banquet was
          to take place in the forum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          I want some one to talk to. What do you think of Flavius

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which had
          attracted her daughter’s attention was a bier supported on the
          shoulders of priests, on which lay a figure dressed handsomely, in
          the attitude <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
          a man at table, raised on his left elbow that was buried in a
          pillow, the head erect and the right arm extended, balanced in the
          air. The body was probably of wood under the drooping drapery, but
          the face and hands and feet were of wax. In jolting over the
          pavement, the sleeve had become disarranged, and showed the wooden
          prop that sustained the waxen right hand. The face was colored, the
          eyes were of glass, and real hair was affixed to the head; the
          lower jaw, hung on wires, opened and shut with the jostling. The
          staring figure swaying on the shoulders of the bearers, had a
          sufficiently startling effect, sweeping round a corner, wagging its
          beard, and past the palanquin in which were the ladies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A thing like that can’t eat,”</span> said Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, my dear child, no. The gods only sniff at the
          food. After it has been set before them, it is carried away, and
          the people scramble for it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They are naught but wax and woodwork,”</span> said the

          that text, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is not well to be overwise

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The forum of
          Rome, that wondrous basin towered over on one side by the Capitol,
          inclosed on another by the Palatine, and on the third by the
          densely packed blocks of houses in the Suburra below the Quirinal,
          Viminal and Esquiline Hills, was itself crowded with temples and
          basilicas, yet not then as dense with monuments as later, when the
          open spaces were further encroached upon by the <a name="corr123"
          id="corr123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">Antonines</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia,”</span> said Longa Duilia, in her ear,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“all things are working out excellently.
          Vitellius is aware <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
          124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that he has no chance, and has been consulting
          with our cousin in the Temple of Concord yonder, and they have
          nearly settled between them that Vespasian is to assume the purple
          without further opposition. Vitellius will retire to some country
          villa on a handsome annuity. That will prevent more bloodshed and
          confiscation, and all that sort of thing. It is always advisable to
          avoid unpleasantnesses if possible. There, child, there are quite a
          bevy of gods already at table. See that dear old doll, Summanus,
          without a head—you know it was struck off by lightning in the time
          of Pyrrhus. It was of clay, and rolled all the way to the Tiber and
          plopped in. Since then he has been without a head, the
          darling!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How can he either smell or eat, mother?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My child, I don’t ask. It is not well to be overwise
          about the gods. There go the Arval Brothers with the image of Aca
          Larentia seated—of course not lying. You will see some venerable
          curiosities, who put in an appearance on days like this so as not
          to be wholly forgotten.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sight
          presented by the forum was indeed strange. A space had been cleared
          and shut off from the intrusion of the crowd, and there lay and sat
          the images at tables that were spread with viands. All were either
          life-size or larger. Some were skilfully modelled, and wore
          gorgeous clothing, but others were of the rudest moulding in terra
          cotta, or carved wood, and evidently of very ancient date, of
          Etruscan workmanship little influenced by Greek art.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia looked
          on in astonishment. The populace laughed and commented on the
          images, without the least reverence; and the priests and their
          assistants <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg
          125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>laid the dishes before the puppets, then
          whisked them off and carried them without the barriers. Thereupon
          ensued a struggle who should get hold of the savory morsels that
          were being conveyed from the table of the gods; even the vessels
          used for the viands and for the wine were snatched at and carried
          away, and the priests offered no resistance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          completely transported out of herself by astonishment at the sight.
          Every now and then the hum of voices spluttered into a burst of
          laughter at some ribald joke, and then roared up into a hubbub of
          sound over the trays of meats and wine that were being fought
          for.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Already the
          short winter day was closing in, and torches were being brought
          forth and stood beside the images. Then the tables were cleared and
          removed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A trumpet blast
          sounded, and instantly the barriers were cast down, and the second
          act of this extraordinary spectacle ensued. This was the
          supplication. Instantly the temper of the mob changed from
          scepticism and mockery to enthusiastic devotion, and those pressed
          forward to kneel and touch the cushions and drapery on which the
          gods reposed, and to entreat their assistance, whose lips had but
          recently uttered a scoff.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing so
          completely differentiates Christian worship from that of Pagan Rome
          as the congregational character of the former contrasted with the
          uncongregational nature of the latter. At the present day in Papal
          Rome the priests may be seen behind glass doors in little chapels
          annexed to S. Peter’s and S. Maria Maggiore saying their offices,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name=
          "Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>indifferent to there
          being no laity present, indeed, with no provision made that they
          should assist. This is a legacy of Pagan Rome. The sacrifices, the
          services in the temples and other sanctuaries, were entirely
          independent of the people, some performed within closed doors. The
          only popular religious service was the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">supplication</span></span>, which took place
          but occasionally. Then the public streamed to the images of the
          gods, uttering fervent prayer, chanting hymns, prostrating
          themselves before the couches, catching at their bed-coverings,
          esteeming themselves blessed if they could lay their hands on the
          sacred pillows. But there was no general consent as to which of the
          gods and goddesses were most potent. Some cried out that Mother
          Orbona had helped them, others that Fortuna was a jade and promised
          but performed nothing. One fanatic, in a transport, shrieked that
          these gods were good for naught, for his part he trusted only in
          Consus, whose temple was in ruins, whose altar was buried in earth
          by the circus of Tarquin. But there were others who swept in a
          strong current towards the couch of Jupiter and of that of Venus.
          Another strong current, howling ‘Io Saturne! Salve Mater Ops!’ made
          for the images of the Old God of Time and his divine Mate.</p>

          came a cross current of vendors of cakes and toys from the Suburra,
          regardless of the devotion of the people, careful only to sell
          their goods—for the Saturnalia was a period at which the children
          were regaled with gingerbread, and treated to dolls of terra cotta,
          of ivory and of wood. Hawkers selling pistachio nuts, the cones of
          the edible pine, men with baked chestnuts, others with trays of
          Pomponian pears <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
          127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and Mattian apples, vociferating and belauding
          their wares, increased the clamor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst this was
          at its height, down from the Palatine by the New Way came the
          German Imperial Body-Guard, forcing a passage through the mob,
          their short swords drawn, bellowing imprecations, whirling their
          blades, striking with the flat of the steel, threatening to cut
          down such as impeded their progress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vigiles</span></span>, or city police, came
          up. There was no love lost between them and the pampered foreigners
          employed in the palace, and they opposed the household troops.
          Remonstrances were employed and cast away. Then a German was struck
          in the face by a pine cone, another tripped, fell, and a hawker
          with a barrow-load of dolls, in his eagerness to escape, ran his
          vehicle over the prostrate guardsman. At once the Germans’ blood
          was up, they rushed upon the police, and a fray ensued in which now
          this side, then that, gained advantage. The populace, densely
          packed, came in for blows and wounds. When a guardsman fell, and
          they could lay hold of him, he was dragged away, and almost torn to
          pieces by eager hands stripping him of his splendid uniform.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Præfect, who
          was in the Forum, summoned three cohorts to his aid, to drive back
          the household troops, and in a moment the trough between the hills
          was converted into a scene of the wildest confusion, some women
          screaming that they had lost their children, others crying to the
          gods to help them. Boys had scrambled up the bases of the statues,
          and one urchin sat with folded legs on the shoulders of Julius
          Cæsar, hallooing, and occasionally pelting with nuts where they did
          not fear retaliation.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
          128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vendors of
          cakes and toys cursed as their trays were upset, or their barrows
          clashed. Men fought each other, for no other reason than that the
          soldiers were engaged, and they were unable to keep their itching
          hands off each other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down a stair
          from the palace came the Emperor Vitellius, carried on the
          shoulders of soldiers, while slaves bore flambeaux before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was seen to
          gesticulate, but in the uproar none heard what he said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile, the
          priests were endeavoring to remove the gods, and met with the
          greatest difficulty. Some frantic women clung to the images and
          refused to allow them to be taken away. Some of the figures had
          been upset, and the servants of the temples to which they belonged
          made rings about them with interlaced arms, to protect them from
          being trampled under foot. Jupiter Capitolinus had been injured and
          lost his nose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A priest with
          the help of a torch, was melting the wax and fastening it on again,
          whilst the guard of the temple kept off the rabble.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The currents of
          human beings, driven by diverse passions, jostled, broke across
          each other, resolved themselves into swirls of living men and women
          carried off their feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The litter of
          the lady Duilia and her daughter tossed like a boat in a whirlpool,
          and the widow shrieked with terror.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then two
          powerful arms were thrust within the curtains of the palanquin, and
          the slave Eboracus laid hold of Domitia, and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is no safety here. Trust me. I will battle

          thrown out, trodden under foot! O my wig! My wig!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Eboracus,
          regardless of the widow, holding his young mistress on his left
          arm, with the right armed with a cudgel, which he whirled like a
          flail, and with which, without compunction he broke down all
          opposition, drove, battered his way through the throng where most
          dense, across the currents most violent, and did not stay till he
          had reached a comparatively unobstructed spot, in one of the narrow
          lanes between the Fish Market and the Hostilian Court.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly had
          Eboracus conveyed Domitia out of the Forum into a place of safety,
          than a rush of people down the street threatened to drive him back
          in the direction whence he had come. The drifting mob, as it
          cascaded down, cried: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Prætorians are
          coming from their camp!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was so. Down
          the hill by the Tiburtine way marched a compact body of
          soldiery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The danger was
          imminent; Eboracus and his young charge were between two masses of
          military, entangled in a seething mob of frightened people, mostly
          of the lowest class.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My lady!”</span> said the slave. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is but one thing to be done.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He drew her to a
          door, knocked, and when a voice asked who demanded admittance,
          answered,</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Open speedily—Paris!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The door was
          furtively unbarred and opened sufficiently to admit the slave and
          Domitia, and then hastily bolted and locked again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Excuse me, dear mistress,”</span> said Eboracus.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I could do no other. In this <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">insula</span></span> live the actor Paris and
          Glyceria. They were both slaves in your household, but were given
          their freedom by your father, my <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          will place themselves at your service, and offer you shelter in
          their humble dwelling, the first flat on the right.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house was
          one of those <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">insulæ</span></span>, islets
          of Rome in which great numbers of the lower classes were housed.
          They consisted in square blocks, built about a court, and ran to
          the height of seven and even more stories. The several flats were
          reached by stone stairs that ran from the central yard to the very
          summit of these barrack-like buildings. They vastly resembled our
          modern model lodging-houses, with one exception, that they had no
          exterior windows, or at most only slits looking into the street;
          doors and windows opened into the central quadrangle. These houses
          were little towns, occupied by numerous families, each family
          renting two or more chambers on a flat, and as in a city there are
          diversities in rank, so was it in these lodging-houses; the most
          abjectly poor were at the very top, or on the ground floor. The
          first flat commanded the highest rent, and the price of rooms
          gradually dwindled, the greater the elevation was. Glass was too
          great a luxury, far too costly to be employed except by the most
          wealthy for filling their windows. Even talc was expensive; in its
          place thin films of agate were sometimes used; but among the poor
          there was little protection in their dwellings against cold. The
          doors admitted light and air and cold together, and were always
          open, except at night, and then a perforation in the wood, or a
          small window in the wall, too narrow to allow of ingress, served
          for ventilation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a huge block
          of building like the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">insula</span></span>, there were no chimneys.
          All cooking was done at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>hearth in the room that served as kitchen and
          dining-room, often also as bedroom, and the smoke found its way out
          at the doorway into the central court.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, in fact,
          little cooking of food was done, except the boiling of pulse. The
          meals of the poor consisted mainly of salads and fruit, with oil in
          abundance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dressed always
          in wool, in cold weather multiplying their wraps, the Roman
          citizens felt the cold weather much less than we might suppose
          possible. In the rain—and in Rome in winter it raineth almost every
          day—the balconies were crowded, and then the women wove, men
          tinkered or patched sandals, children romped, boys played marbles
          and knuckle-bones, and sometimes a minstrel twanged a lyre and the
          young girls danced to keep themselves warm. There were little
          braziers, moreover, one on every landing, that were kept alight
          with charcoal, and here, when the women’s fingers were numb, they
          were thawed, and children baked chestnuts or roasted apples.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia had
          never been in one of these blocks of habitations of the lower
          classes before, and she was surprised. The quadrangle was almost
          like an amphitheatre, with its tiers of seats for spectators; but
          here, in place of seats, were balconies, and every balcony was
          alive with women and children. Men were absent; they had gone out
          to see the commencement of the Saturnalia, and of women there were
          few compared to the numbers that usually thronged these
          balconies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus
          conducted his young mistress up the first flight of steps, and at
          once a rush of children was made to him to ask for toys and cakes.
          He brushed them aside, and when the mothers saw by the purple edge
          to her dress that Domitia belonged to a noble family, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they called their youngsters away, and
          saluted her by raising thumb and forefinger united to the lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slave at
          once conducted Domitia through a doorway into a little chamber,
          where burnt a fire of olive sticks, and a lamp was suspended, by
          the light of which she could see that a sick woman lay on a low
          bed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia shrank
          back; but Eboracus said encouragingly:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Be not afraid, dear young mistress; this is no
          catching disorder; Glyceria suffers from an accident, and will
          never be well again. She is the sister of your servant
          Euphrosyne.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then,
          approaching the sick woman, he hastily explained the reason for his
          taking refuge with his mistress in this humble lodging.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sick woman
          turned to Domitia with a sweet smile, and in courteous words
          entreated her to remain in her chamber so long as was
          necessary.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My husband, Paris, the actor, is now out; but he will
          be home shortly, I trust—unless,”</span> her face grew paler with
          sudden dread, <span class="tei tei-q">“some ill have befallen him.
          Yet I think not that can be, he is a quiet, harmless
          man.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I thank you,”</span> answered Domitia, and took a seat
          offered her by Eboracus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked
          attentively at the sick woman’s face. She was no longer young, she
          had at one time been beautiful, she had large, lustrous dark eyes,
          and dark hair, but pain and weakness had sharpened her features.
          Yet there was such gentleness, patience, love in her face, a
          something which to Domitia was so new, a something so new in that
          old world, that she could not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>take her eyes off her, wondering what the
          fascination was.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria did not
          speak again, modestly waiting till the lady of rank chose to
          address her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently
          Domitia asked:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Have you been long ill?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is here.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the door
          came the actor, a handsome man, of Greek type, with a package in
          his arms. He would have walked straight to his wife, but had to
          turn at the door and drive off a clamorous pack of urchins who had
          pursued him, believing that he was laden with toys.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There, Glyceria!”</span> he exclaimed joyously;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they are all for you. There is such a riot
          and disturbance and such a crush in the street, that I had hard
          work to push through. I misdoubt me some are broken.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, Paris! do you not observe?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What? I see nothing but thy sweet face?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Our dear master’s daughter, the lady Domitia
          Longina.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The actor turned
          sharply, and was covered with confusion at the unexpected sight,
          and almost let his parcel fall.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus
          explained the circumstances. Then Paris expressed his happiness,
          and the pride he felt in being honored by the visit under his
          humble ceiling, of the lady, the daughter of the good and beloved
          master who had given him and Glyceria their freedom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Go forth, Eboracus,”</span> said Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and I prithee learn how it has fared with my mother.
          Bring me word speedily, if thou canst.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the slave
          had withdrawn, she addressed Paris and Glyceria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I beseech you, suffer me to remain here in quiet, and
          concern not yourselves about me. I have been alarmed, and this has
          shaken me. I would fain rest in this seat and not speak. Go on with
          what ye have to say and do, and consider me not. So will you best
          please me.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg
          136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The actor was
          somewhat constrained at first, but after a little while overcame
          his reserve. He drew a low table beside his wife’s couch, and,
          stooping on one knee, began to unlade his bundle. He set out a
          number of terra cotta figures on the table, representing cocks and
          hens, pigs, horses, cows and men; some infinitely comical; at them
          Glyceria laughed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as she put
          forth a thin white hand to take up one of the quaintest images,
          Domitia noticed that Paris laid hold of it, and pressed it to his
          lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A lump rose in
          the girl’s throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> thought she; <span class="tei tei-q">“if I
          had one so to love me and consider me, though I were sick and in
          pain, I would not shorten my days. I would live to enjoy his
          love.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then again,
          falling into further musing, she said to herself:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In time to come, if it chance that I become ill, will
          my Lamia be to me as is this actor to his poor wife? Will he think
          of and care for me? But—and if evil were to befall him, would not I
          minister to him, care for him night and day, and seek to relieve
          his sorrow? Would I grow indifferent when he most needed me? Then
          why think that he should become cold and neglect me? Are women more
          inclined to be true than men?—Yet see this actor—this Paris. By the
          Gods! Is Lamia like to be a more ignoble man than a poor freedman
          that gains his living on the stage?—I should even be happy serving
          him sick and suffering. Happy in doing my duty.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And still
          musing, she said on to herself:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Duty! Yes, I should find content and rest of mind in
          that; but to what would it all lead? Only to a heap of dust in the
          end. His light would be extinguished, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and then I, having nothing else to live for,
          would die also—by mine own hand:—there is nothing beyond. It all
          leads to an ash-heap.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria,
          observing the girl’s fixed eye, thought it was looking inquiringly
          at her, and said in her gentle voice that vibrated with the
          tremulousness given by suffering:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, lady! the neighbors and their children are very
          kind. There is more of goodness and piety in the world than you
          would suppose, seeing men and women only in an amphitheatre. I can
          do but very little. One boy fetches me water—that is Bibulus, and
          my Paris has bought him this little horseman—and Torquata, a little
          girl, daughter of a cobbler, she sweeps the floor; and Dosithea,
          that is a good widow’s child; she does other neighborly acts for
          me;—and they thrust me on my bed to the side of the hearth, and
          bring me such things as I need, that I may prepare the meals for my
          husband. And Claudia, the wife of a seller of nets, she makes my
          bed for me; but all the shopping is done for me by Paris, and I
          warrant you, lady, he is quite knowing, and can haggle over a fish
          or a turnip with a market-woman like any housewife.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is very good to you,”</span> said Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Paris
          turned, and, putting his hand on his wife’s mouth, said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady! you can little know what a wife my Glyceria is
          to me. I had rather for my own sake have her thus than hale as of
          old. Somehow, sorrow and pain draw hearts together
          wondrously.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is good,”</span> said Glyceria, twisting her mouth
          from his covering hand. <span class="tei tei-q">“We have had a hard
          year; on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
          138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>account of the troubles, there has been little
          desire among the people for the theatre, and he has earned but a
          trifle. I have cost him much in physicians that have done me no
          good, yet he never grumbles, he is always cheerful, always
          tender-hearted and loving.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hush, wife!”</span> said Paris. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The lady desires rest. Keep silence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then again
          Domitia fell a-musing, and the player and his wife whispered to
          each other about the destination of the several toys.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somehow she had
          hitherto not thought of the classes of men and women below her
          station as having like feelings, like longings, like natures to her
          own. They had been to her as puppets, even as those clay figures
          ranged on the table, mostly grotesque. Now that great pulse of love
          that throbs through the world of humanity made itself felt, it was
          as though scales fell from her eyes, and the puppets became beings
          of flesh and blood to be considered, capable of happiness and of
          suffering, of virtue as well as of vice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have a little lamp here—with a fish—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></span>
          fish on it,”</span> said Paris in a whisper. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is for Luke, the Physician.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What!”</span> exclaimed Domitia, starting from her
          reverie, <span class="tei tei-q">“you know him? We had a talk once,
          and it was broken off and never concluded. I would hear the end of
          what he was saying—some day.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus brushed
          aside some urchins and girls blocking the door, looking in with
          eager, twinkling eyes at the strange lady and at the set out of
          dolls on the table.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There passed
          whispers and nudges from one to another—but all ceased as the
          British slave put together his hands as a swimmer and plunged
          through them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then entering,
          he said to Domitia:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady, your mother has reached home in safety. I
          chanced to run across Amphibolus, sent out in quest of you, and the
          good-for-naught had turned sulky, because it is the Saturnalia,
          when, said he, the mistress should do the slave’s bidding.
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘That can be,’</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘but at one time in the year, and should not be
          forgotten.’</span> And the lanes are clear of rabble. If Paris here
          will walk on one side of you and I on the other, it will be well.
          That rascal Amphibolus I bade wait, but not he, said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Io Saturne!’</span> ”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will attend with joy,”</span> announced the
          actor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia rose to
          leave, she tendered thanks to Glyceria and took two steps towards
          the entrance, halted, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
          140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>turned back, and taking the thin hand of the
          sick woman in hers, somewhat shyly said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I may come again and see you?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before Glyceria
          could reply, so great was her surprise, Domitia was gone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The streets were
          nearly empty, they were mere lanes between huge blocks of
          windowless buildings, towering into the sky, but from the forum
          could be heard a hubbub of voices, cries, the clash of arms, and
          anon a cheer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
          Presently—<span class="tei tei-q">“Stand aside!”</span> said Paris,
          and there swept down the lane a number of young fellows masked and
          tricked out in ribbons and scraps of tawdry finery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          woman. She shall be my captive and grace my triumph.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus
          administered a blow with his fist, planted between the eyes of the
          youth in pasteboard armor who came towards his young mistress. The
          blow sent him flying backwards against the king and upset him on
          the pavement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A roar of
          laughter from his mates, and one shouted,</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hey Tarquinius! thou must e’en fare like the rest,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let us go on,”</span> said Paris, and without further
          attempt at molestation from the revellers they pursued their
          way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching the
          palace inhabited by Longa Duilia, a fresh difficulty arose.
          Eboracus knocked, but there was no porter at the door to answer. He
          knocked again and continued to rattle against the panels, till
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name=
          "Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at length the bolt
          was withdrawn, and Euphrosyne with timid face, and holding a lamp
          appeared in the entrance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why have you kept us so long waiting?”</span> asked
          the Briton.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Eboracus, I could not help myself. It is the
          Saturnalia, and the slaves will do no menial work. They are
          carousing in the triclinium and, though they heard the rap well
          enough, none would rise and respond. Then, for very shame I came,
          for I thought it might be my dear mistress.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Domitia
          crossed the atrium, she heard song and laughter and the click of
          goblets issue from the dining-room. She hurried by and entered her
          mother’s chamber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia was
          in a condition of resentment and irritation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You have arrived at last!”</span> said the lady.

          basted when the Seven Days are over, for disregarding me and
          considering your safety alone. Body of Bacchus! This time of the

          nor execute a single order. They are all, forsooth, lords and
          ladies for seven days, and we must wait on them. Well! if it were
          not an old custom, I’d get up a procession of all the matrons of
          Rome to entreat the Senate to abolish the usage.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          But after a while they got me through. Never, never again will I go
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name=
          "Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gadding after the
          Gods to their Lectisternia. As the Gods love me! this is a
          topsy-turvy time indeed. At the Saturnalia no strife is
          permissible, not a lawsuit, all quarrels are supposed to cease, not
          even a malefactor may be executed, and there are those precious
          Immortals with their glass eyes, and extended hands snuffing up the
          fumes of their dinner, and they allow fighting to go on before
          them, under their immortal noses, and never interfere! But I don’t
          wonder. There was Summanus, God of the night thunders—and will you
          believe it, his own head was struck off by the heavenly bolt. Ye
          Gods! if ye cannot mind your own heads ye are not to be trusted
          with ours.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady was in
          a condition of towering indignation. She was affronted—she,
          highborn, with a drop of Julian blood in her, somewhere,—she had
          been tossed about among the heads and over the shoulders of a
          dirty, garlic-smelling asafœtida chewing rabble—had been exposed to
          danger from the swords of the Vigiles on one side, of the Palatine
          guard on the other. And when finally, she reached home ruffled in
          garments, her hair in disorder, and her heart beating fast, she
          found the house in disorder, the slaves in possession keeping high
          holiday, and disregarding her shrilly uttered, imperiously
          expressed orders.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I shall go to bed,”</span> said the lady, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I’d lie in bed all these horrible seven days, but that
          I know no one will bring me my meals. Never mind—when the
          Saturnalia are over, I shall remember which were insolent and
          disobliging, and they shall get whippings.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in the
          house, on the morrow the condition of affairs was not quite so bad.
          The servants were alive to the fact that they had liberty for seven
          days only, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
          143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and that their mistress had a faculty of
          remembering and punishing disobedience; not indeed during the
          holiday period, nor ostensibly because of faults then committed,
          but by administering double chastisement for light offences
          committed later.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          slaves, moreover, made no attempt to use their liberty so as to
          cause inconvenience to their mistress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if some sort
          of order was established within the palace, none reigned without.
          There civil war raged, at the same time that the citizens observed
          the festival, and so long as they kept out of the way of the
          soldiery, it did not much concern them whether the city force or
          the palace garrison prevailed. Primus, at the head of the Illyrian
          legions was rapidly advancing on Rome. News had arrived that Spain
          and Gaul had declared for Vespasian. Britain had renounced
          allegiance to Vitellius, only Africa still remained faithful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next tidings
          arrived that the army of Vitellius that was at Narnia had
          surrendered. Thereupon the gross, aged Emperor dressed in black,
          surrounded by his servants, and carrying his son, still a child,
          came howling and sobbing from the Palatine through the Forum, to
          surrender the insignia of Empire into the hands of the Consul, in
          the Temple of Concord. But the Consul refused to receive them, and
          then the German guard, having wind of his intention, became
          clamorous, and cried out for the head of Flavius Sabinus.
          Vitellius, unable to resign, and incapable of reigning, wandered
          from one residence to another, asking advice of all his friends as
          to what he ought to do, but taking none.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
          fighting in the streets of Rome had recommenced. Titus Flavius
          Sabinus, for security <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
          144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>escaped into the Capitol, and took with him
          his sons and daughter, and his nephew Domitian. There he was
          formally besieged by the Imperial guard; and Sabinus, doubting his
          ability to hold out long, sent off a despatch to Primus to bid him
          hasten to his assistance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam!”</span> exclaimed Eboracus rushing in,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray you come on the roof of the
          house.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What is the matter? Ye Gods! surely Rome is not on
          fire again!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam! The household guard are assaulting the Capitol
          and have indeed set fire to the houses below, I doubt if the
          Præfect can hold out till Primus arrives.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Duilia ascended
          to the flat top of the house. The palace of the family was in the
          Carinæ, on the slope of the Esquiline hill, hard by the gardens of
          Nero’s Golden House. Being on high ground it commanded the Forum
          and the Capitol, and looked over the tops of the vulgar <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">insulæ</span></span> in the dip of the
          Suburra.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the
          evening of the second day. Heavy clouds had lowered throughout the
          hours of daylight and the evening had prematurely closed. There had
          been desultory fighting all day, but as the night approached a
          determined set was made by the German guard to capture the Capitol,
          and the citadel of Rome that adjoined it, connected by only a small
          neck of hill. They knew that Primus was close at hand, and they
          were determined not to be caught between a foe before and another
          behind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Capitol is a
          rocky height rising precipitately above the Forum, and enormous
          substructures had strengthened it and formed a platform on which
          rose the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus that stood to Rome almost in
          the relation that the Temple did to Jeru<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>salem, as the centre of its religious and
          civil institutions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was almost
          the paladium of the city, the fate of Rome was held to be bound up
          with its preservation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Domitia
          and her mother looked on in the gathering darkness at the temple
          looming out as of gold against the purple black clouds behind, lit
          with the glare of the flames of the houses below that had been
          fired by the soldiery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The roar of
          conflict came up in waves of sound.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Really,”</span> said Duilia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Revolutions are only tolerable when seen from a
          house-top; that is, to cultivated minds—the common rabble like
          them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shrill above the
          roar came the scream of a whistle, that a boy was blowing as he
          went down the street.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly the
          clamor boiled up into a mighty spout or geyser of noise, and the
          reason became manifest in another moment. The whole sky was lit by
          a sheet of flame of golden yellow. The conflagration had caught an
          oil merchant’s stores that were planted against the substructures
          supporting the temple. Columns, shoots of dazzling light rushed up
          against the rocks and the walls, recoiled, swept against them
          again, overleaped them and curled like tongues around the
          temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly every
          sound ceased. The soldiers sheathed their swords. The citizens held
          their breath. Nothing for a few minutes was audible, save the
          mutter of the fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My lady,”</span> said Euphrosyne, coming to the roof,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A minute later,
          the Chaldæan himself arrived on the housetop and addressed the

          impatient toss of her head and shrug of her shoulders, gathered up
          her garment with one hand, stepped to a distant part of the roof,
          and said, sulkily—</p>

          the Illyrian legions will have arrived in Rome. Do you suppose the
          German bodyguard can stand against them? What other troops has
          Vitellius to fall back on? None—he is deserted. His cause is
          fatally smitten. By to-morrow evening he will be dead, cast down
          the Gemonian stair. Vespasian will be proclaimed in the Forum. Your
          risk will be at an end, and you will have obtained the lasting
          gratitude of the Imperial father, who will do anything you desire,
          to show his thankfulness to you for having saved the life of his
          son.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is something in that,”</span> said Duilia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And suppose now that Domitian is here, that you bid
          your slaves eject him, and he falls into the hands of Vitellius,
          how will you be regarded by the Flavian family? Do you not suppose
          that you will be the first to suffer the resentment of the
          Augustus?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is a good deal in that,”</span> said Duilia, to
          which the Magus said,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have no fear of betrayal from any in the house save
          Senecio, that owl-like philosopher. He is not like the slaves, he
          may suspect, and trip me up.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My good Elymas,”</span> interrupted Duilia,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“do not concern yourself about him. He is
          not a man to chew nutshells when he can munch kernels.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitian is in my apartment, will you see him,
          lady?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By all means. I have a notion. Go, fetch Domitia,
          bring her down there to me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Longa
          descended to that portion of the mansion where were situated the
          rooms given up to the soothsayer; they were on one side of a small
          court, and the philosopher occupied chambers on the other side.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name=
          "Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Across the water tank
          in the midst many an altercation had taken place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Senecio was not
          there now. He was probably out taking a philosophic view of the
          internecine strife, and moralizing over the burning of the
          Capitol.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a benignant
          smile and a tear in her eye, Duilia almost ran to Domitian, her two
          hands extended. She had just looked round the court to make sure
          she was unobserved and that there was no one within earshot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am so grateful to the Gods,”</span> she said, with a
          tremor in her voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“that they should
          allow me the honor and happiness of offering you an asylum. Blood
          is thicker than water. Though I perish for my advocacy of your dear
          father—I cannot help it. Cousins must be cousinly. It is with us a
          family peculiarity—we hang together like a swarm of
          bees.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man
          cautiously removed his white veil or head-covering, and exposed his
          face, that was somewhat pale. He had a shy modest appearance, a
          delicate complexion that flushed and paled at the changes of
          emotion in his heart. His eyes were a watery gray, large, but he
          screwed the eyelids together, as though near-sighted. He was fairly
          well built, but had spindle legs, no calves, and his toes as if cut
          short.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In manner he was
          awkward, without ease in his address; owing to the low associates
          with whom he had consorted, having been kept short of money, and to
          his lack of acquaintance with the courtesies of the cultured
          classes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I thank you. My life is in danger. I came hither, as
          my uncle supped here the other day, and I knew something about

          out and murdered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg

          They would have sought me there first of all.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You shall stay here till all danger is past. I should
          esteem myself the vilest of women were I to refuse you my
          protection at such a time as this. Senecio, my philosopher, is out,
          gadding about—of course. You shall occupy his room, and I shall
          give strict orders that he be not admitted. I will not have
          philosophers careering in and out of my house, at all hours, as
          pleases them. This is not a rabbit warren, as the Gods love me! But
          here comes my daughter to unite with me in assurance of welcome and
          protection.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia had
          entered, in obedience to the command transmitted by the
          sorcerer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was but
          one oil lamp on a table in the chamber, and consequently at first
          she did not discern who was there addressed by her mother. But
          Duilia stepped aside and allowed the light to flash over the face
          of Domitian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moment the
          girl saw it, she started back and put her hands to her bosom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          dear good friend Flavius Sabinus. Poor man, how he enjoyed himself
          at supper here the other day! We may hope for the best, but not
          expect impossibilities. Revolutions and all these sorts of things
          have their natural exits, the sword, the Tullianum and the Gemonian
          steps—horrible, but inevitable. Domitian has fled to us, disguised
          as a priest of Jupiter. O my dear, what a nice thing it is that
          there is so much religion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Duilia raised

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian started

          which shall be uppermost, and if fate favors Vitellius—Then,
          daughter, I shall not scruple to give the young man up.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condition of
          the capital was frightful. Vitellius had called in levies from the
          country to support him, and the prætorian soldiers stood firm. But
          many men of direction were with the partisans of Vespasian, who
          advanced steadily over the bodies of the troops opposing them.
          Fifty thousand persons lost their lives in these eventful days of
          the Saturnalia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legions
          under Primus succeeded in recapturing the Capitol, which was still
          smoking, and pushed forward into the Forum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile,
          Vitellius, in the Palatine palace, a prey to irresolution, had
          filled himself with wine, and then fled along with his cook and
          pastrycook to his wife’s house on the Aventine. Then deceived by a
          false report that his troops were successful, he returned to the
          Palatine, and found it deserted, but a roar of voices rose from the
          Forum below, and from the Capitol the cries of the legionaries were
          wafted towards him along with the smoke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hastened to
          collect all the gold he could lay his hands on, stuffed it into his
          cincture, assumed an old ragged suit, and then again attempted to
          escape; but now he found every avenue blocked. Filled with terror
          he crawled into the dog-kennel where the hounds, resenting the
          intrusion, fell on him and bit his neck and hands and legs. But now
          Vespasian’s soldiery invaded the palace, and a tribune, Julius
          Placidius, dis<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
          160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=

          him out by the foot, and he came forth thus, his hands full of
          dirty straw, and strands adhering to his hair and garments. A
          howling rabble at once surrounded him, leaping, jeering, throwing
          mud and stones; a few soldiers succeeded in surrounding him. His
          hands were bound behind his back, and a rope passed about his neck.
          Thus he was dragged through the streets an object of insult to the
          people. Some struck him in the face, some plucked out his hair. In
          the Forum the rabble were breaking his statues and dragging them
          about. One ruffian thrust a pike under the unfortunate prince’s
          chin and bade him hold up his head. Then said Vitellius:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou, who thus addressest me—a tribune thou art,
          remember I was once thy commander!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon a
          German soldier, desirous of shortening his misery, struck him down
          with a blow of his sword, and in so doing cut off the ear of the
          tribune who had insulted the fallen Emperor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At once the body
          of the prince, from whom the life was not sped, was dragged to the
          Gemonian stair, a flight of steps down which the corpses of
          malefactors were flung, and there he was despatched with
          daggers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia had
          been kept well informed as to all that took place.</p>

          she assured that Vitellius was dead, than she rushed into the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The anarchy
          which had lasted from the 11th June, 68, when Nero perished, came
          to an end on the 20th December, in the ensuing year. In that
          terrible year of 69, three emperors had died violent deaths, and
          Rome had been in a condition of disorder on each occasion, and
          intermittent violence had lasted all the time. Men now drew a long
          breath, they were disposed to blot out the memory of those eighteen
          months of misery and national humiliation, as though it had not
          been, and to reckon the strong Vespasian as prince next after Nero.
          Indeed, on the morrow of the death of Vitellius, when the Senate
          assembled and decreed the honors of the former princes, they
          recited those of the first Cæsars, but ignored the three last who
          had perished within a twelvemonth, as though they had never been,
          and were to be forgotten as an evil dream.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That same day
          also, Domitian received the title of Cæsar, and was made Prince of
          the Youths, and Præfect of Rome in the place of his uncle, who had
          been murdered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That day, also,
          Mucianus arrived with the Syrian legions, and with plenitude of
          authority from Vespasian to act in his name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Duilia’s vast
          delight Domitian did not forget his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>obligation to her, but paid frequent visits to
          her house, and it was a matter of pride to her to have his
          attendant lictors standing outside her door, as in former days.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he came,
          she made a point of summoning her daughter, and requiring her to be
          present during the interview. But she could not make her speak or
          compel her to graciousness of manner towards the visitor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young
          prince’s eyes watched the girl with question in them, but he
          addressed all his conversation to the mother.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia did
          her utmost to disguise her child’s incivility, attributed it to
          shyness, and used all her blandishments to make a visit to her
          house agreeable to Domitian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length, the
          irksomeness caused by Domitia’s irresponsive manner seemed to
          satisfy the mother that she did more harm than good in enforcing
          her attendance, and she ceased to require the girl to appear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some months
          passed, and Domitia had not given a thought to Glyceria, and her
          offer to revisit the sick woman, when, all at once, in a fit of
          weariness with all things that surrounded her, and a sense of
          incapacity to find enjoyment anywhere, she started from her languor
          to bid Eboracus go forth, buy honey-cakes and toys, and accompany
          her on a visit to the Suburra.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she was on
          her way, Domitian came by with his lictors and other attendants.
          Since his elevation from poverty and insignificance to ease and
          importance, he had acquired a swagger that made his manner more
          offensive than before in his phase of cubbishness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He at once
          addressed her, for though veiled he recognized her.</p><span class=

          women weaving and spinning, and children romping and running
          races.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was welcomed
          with pleasure, Glyceria would have raised herself, had she been

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chamber was
          fragrant with violets.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia looked
          round and saw a small marble table on which stood a statuette of a
          shepherd with panpipes, and a lamb across his shoulders. Violets in
          a basin stood before the figure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was not
          particularly interested in the matter. She presumed that some
          foreign cult was followed by Glyceria, and foreign cults at this

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dear,”</span> said Longa Duilia to her daughter,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“with wit such as you have, that might be
          drawn through a needle’s eye, it is positively necessary to have
          you married as quickly as possible. I can no longer bear the
          responsibility of one so full of waywardness and humors as
          yourself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That, mother, is as Lamia chooses. You know that I can
          marry only him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And I do not ask you to take another. I will get it
          settled forthwith. I’ll see his father by adoption and have the
          settlements looked to. You are a good match. I presume you are
          aware of that, and this explains certain poutings and bad temper.
          Well—reserve them for Lamia, and don’t vex me. I wash my hands of
          you, when that you are married. A camel carries his own hump, but a
          man his wife’s humors.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          sufficiently acquainted with her mother’s elasticity of spirit and
          fertility of invention to be satisfied that she had a motive for
          pressing on her marriage, and what that motive was seemed obvious.
          But it was one that distressed her greatly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dearest mother,”</span> she said timidly,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I hope—I mean, since you are so good as
          not to urge me further to break my engagement with Lamia, that you
          have not set your mind—I mean your heart——”</span></p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My excellent child,”</span> answered Longa Duilia
          cutting her daughter short, <span class="tei tei-q">“make no
          scruple of blurting out what is on your tongue. You allude to
          Domitian. Well! If you had common sense, you would know that to get
          on in life, one must fit one’s heart with the legs of a
          grasshopper, so as to be able to skip from an inconvenient, into
          any suitable position. When a dish of ortolans is set on table,
          none but a fool will dismiss it untasted to be devoured by the
          servants in the kitchen!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But, mother, he is quite young.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the favor of the Gods, Domitia, youths always fall
          in love with women somewhat older than themselves. The Gods ordered
          it for their good. If they, I mean the young men—would only follow
          their—I mean the Gods’—direction, there would be fewer unhappy
          marriages. For my part, I can’t see anything attractive in
          half-baked girls.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the thoughts
          of her own future, and approaching happiness took up the whole of
          Domitia’s brain, and left no space for consideration of her
          mother’s schemes, and their chances of success.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young prince
          was away. It was, as had been feared, too late for him to reap
          laurels in Germany, the revolt had been quelled by Cerealis, but as
          there was a ferment working in Gaul, it was deemed advisable that
          Domitian should go thither and overcome the dissatisfied instead of
          crossing the Alps. He had accordingly changed his route, and had
          appeared in Lyons.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The marriage
          between Domitia and Lamia could not take place so speedily as
          Duilia desired. She was wishful to have it over before the return
          to Rome of Domitian, so that she might be left a freer hand, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name=
          "Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her daughter put out
          of the way who, she thought, exercised a peculiar fascination over
          the young prince; but she was unable to decide in her own mind
          whether what drew his eyes towards Domitia was dislike or love;
          possibly it was a commingling of resentment at her treatment of
          him, and admiration for her loveliness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But hindrances
          arose. Lamia was absent on his estates in Sicily, where there had
          been disturbances among the slaves, and till matters were settled
          there, he could not return.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
          month of May in which no marriages might be performed owing to the
          hauntings of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Lemures</span></span>, or
          ghosts of bad men, and such as had not received burial. These, seen
          in the forms of walking skeletons or bugbears, rioted in that
          sweetest month of the whole year. Then they obtained opportunities
          among the incautious to slip into their bodies, and possess them
          with madness, or to take up their abodes in dwelling-houses and
          disturb the living occupants by phantom appearances and mysterious
          sounds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On three days in
          the month of May special means were adopted to propitiate or scare
          away these spectres. On the 9th, 11th, and 13th, at midnight, the
          master of a house, or, in the event of his death or absence, his
          widow or wife, walked barefoot before the door to a flowing
          fountain, where the hands were thrice washed, and then the
          propitiator of the ghosts returned home, and threw black beans over
          the shoulder, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“These I give to you,
          and with these beans I ransom myself and mine.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was supposed
          that the ghost scrambled for the beans, and so enabled the owner of
          the house to reach <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
          172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the door before them. There stood the servants
          beating brazen vessels, pots and pans, shouting, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Out with you! Out with you, ye ghosts!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the beginning
          of June was the cleansing of the Temple of Vesta, and till that was
          completed, on the 15th, marriages were forbidden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consequently the
          wedding could not take place much before midsummer, and to this
          Longa Duilia had to submit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          content and happy. She had not been so happy since her father’s
          death. Indeed till now she had not been able to shake off the pain
          she had felt at his loss. For to her, that father was the model of
          noble manhood, high-minded, full of integrity, strong yet gentle.
          She had often marvelled at the manner in which he had dealt with
          her mother, whom she indeed loved but who somewhat rasped her. With
          his wife he had ever been firm yet forbearing. He allowed her to
          form her little schemes, but always managed to thwart them when
          foolish or mischievous, without her perceiving who had put a spoke
          in the wheel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lucius Ælius
          Lamia she looked upon as formed in her father’s school, upon his
          model. He was modest, honorable, true; a good man to whom she could
          give her whole heart with full assurance that he would treasure the
          gift, and that she could trust him to be as true to her as she
          would be true to him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since her
          father’s death, Domitia had felt more than previously the
          incompatibility of her mind with that of her mother. They had no
          thoughts, no wishes, no feelings in common. Domitia was a dreamer,
          speculative, ever with eager mind seeking the things beyond what
          was known, whereas Duilia had not a thought, a <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>care that were not material. The lady
          Duilia cared not a rush about philosophy or the theory of
          emanations. It was to her a matter of complete indifference whether
          the established paganism was true or false. For she had no
          apprehension of the importance of Truth. And she had no wish that
          could not be gratified by money or the acquisition of position.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now also the
          haunting horror of those waking dreams that she had seen in the
          Temple of Isis passed from the heart of the young girl, like the
          vapors that roll away and disclose the blue heavens and the
          glorious sun. She had been drifting purposeless; now she saw that
          she was about to enter on a condition of life in which she would
          have an object, and would find complete happiness in the pursuit of
          that object,—in the fulfilment of her duties as housewife to a
          loved husband, in whom she would find strength, sympathy and
          love.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now also,
          for the first time since the death of Corbulo, she sang as she went
          about the house, or worked at her bridal dress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia, on his
          return from Sicily was surprised to note the change in her
          appearance. She had been as a beautiful flower bowed by rain and
          pinched with cold, and now, as in renewed sunshine, she bloomed
          with expanded petals. Light danced in her blue eyes, and a delicate
          rose suffused her smooth cheeks. She had stepped back into the
          childhood out of which she had passed on that terrible day at
          Cenchræa.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And as he looked
          at her, her eyes sparkling with love and tears of joy, he thought
          he had never seen one sweeter and to whom he could so wholly devote
          himself as to his dear Domitia.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then arrived the
          eve of the marriage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young girl
          was in the garden, stooping, picking the flowers of which her
          virginal crown was to be woven, and singing as she plucked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she came
          with her lap full of herbs and blossoms to her mother, who
          said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That is right. None may gather the flowers but the
          bride. By the way, have you heard? Domitian is back from Gaul. I
          was rejoiced at the news, and have despatched an invitation to him
          to attend the wedding.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, mother! it is a bad omen.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the mention
          of the name, the vision of the red face, seen at Gabii between her
          own and that of Lamia, started up before her, and she let drop the
          lap of flowers, and they fell at her feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the Gods! what a silly thing thou art! Quick,
          gather up the herbs and then go fetch thy dolls and toys of
          childhood, they must all this evening be offered on the altar of
          the household gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have them not, mother.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But what have you done with them? I know they were all
          brought from Antioch.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mother, they have been given away.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Given away! to whom?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But what can have induced you to do this?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She is paralyzed, and served by little children in the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          then you can present them at the altar, and the Gods will be none

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia stooped

          for a twelvemonth. That is right also, the scarlet anemone, it

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the earliest
          rays of dawn the auguries were taken, not as of old by the flight
          of birds, but by inspection of the liver and heart of a sheep, that
          was slaughtered for the purpose by the Aruspices, and this done
          they came to the palace of Duilia, bearing the skin of the sheep,
          to announce that the portents were favorable, in fact, were of
          extraordinarily good promise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          the girl has not been able to get her hands white yet. The stain of
          that nefast herb is on them still. But—ah! here she comes in her
          flame-colored veil. By the Body of Bacchus! after all it means no
          ill, for do not her hands agree in hue with her

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia had laid
          aside her maidenly dress, the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">toga prætextata</span></span> woven with
          horizontal stripes, for the dress of a married woman, the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">toga recta</span></span>, with vertical
          stripes. About her waist was a woollen girdle fastened in a
          peculiar manner, with the so-called knot of Hercules, that was
          regarded as a charm against the evil eye, and was also employed in
          binding up wounds and fractured bones. The girl’s dress, as well as
          a net of red silk <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
          178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=

          the previous day, had been offered on the altars of the ancestral
          deities worshipped in the house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her hair had
          been divided that morning, not by a comb, but by the head of a
          lance, into six tresses that were plaited with colored ribbons. And
          about her head, beneath the veil, was the virgin’s wreath woven out
          of the flowers she had herself picked—but the ill-omened cypress
          and the blood distilling <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">androsœmum</span></span> had been <span class=
          "tei tei-corr">omitted.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now with
          pipes and cymbals came the bridegroom attended by all his friends,
          to fetch the bride home. The house door was decorated with laurels,
          and incense smoked on the domestic altars, in the vestibule, and in
          the atrium. The boxes that contained the ancestral wax masks were
          open, and each face was wreathed about with flowers. Green lines
          connecting the boxes united all to one trunk forming a family tree.
          The household gods were not ignored, lamps burned before them,
          flowers adorned their heads, and cakes and wine were placed on
          shelves below them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Slaves ran to
          and fro, and ran against each other. Ten witnesses, kinsmen of the
          bride and bridegroom, assembled to take cognizance of the marriage
          contract. Two seats were introduced into the hall, and the legs
          bound together, and over both was spread the skin of the sheep
          slaughtered that morning for the auspices.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then bride and
          bridegroom were seated on these stools, the marriage contract was
          read aloud, and they received the salutations of their <span class=
          "tei tei-corr">friends. The</span> <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pronuba</span></span>, a married female
          relative united their hands, and that accomplished, the bridegroom
          rose, and attended by the friends and kinsfolk of both parties,
          departed for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
          179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the Temple of Jupiter, where the flamen Dialis
          offered sacrifice to the gods of marriage, to Jupiter, Juno,
          Tellus, and the old Latin half-forgotten deities of Picumnus and
          Pilumnus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the
          sacred sacrifice was being performed, in the house of the bride all
          was being made ready for the wedding or meal after midday.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bride was
          now esteemed to have passed out of the family of her father into
          that of her husband, his gods would be her gods, his house her
          house, his name hers. In signification of this the formula was used
          by her, <span class="tei tei-q">“Since thou art Caius, I am
          Caia.”</span> At a remote period it would have been <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Since thou art Lucius I am Lucia,”</span> and she
          would have lost her name of Domitia. But this was no longer
          customary, only the liturgical form of surrender was employed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was past noon
          when the procession returned, swelled by more friends and by all
          well-wishers, and as it entered the house, with a shiver Domitia
          observed the glowing face and water-blue eyes of the young prince,
          attended by his lictors. She caught his glance, but he dropped his
          eyes the moment they encountered hers, and she saw his cheeks
          pucker, as though with laughter. But she had no time to give
          thought to him; she was required to acknowledge the felicitations
          of the visitors, and to entreat them to partake of the hospitality
          of the hour, and to offer a pinch of incense and a libation to her
          happiness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The supper was
          lengthy—many partook and came in relays, so that the entire
          afternoon was consumed by it. To the relief of Domitia, the prince
          Domitian had withdrawn. As each left the table he saluted the bride
          with the exclamation, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Feliciter</span></span>.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For this long
          and tedious ceremonial feast, she was allowed to rest on a couch,
          next to her husband, at the table, in the place of honor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meal lasted
          till evening, and then there ensued a movement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The household
          goods of the bride, her spindle and distaff, her chest containing
          robes, were brought forth, and placed on biers to be conveyed to
          the new house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          rose, with tears in her eyes, and went to the several chambers she
          had occupied, to say farewell to the kitchen, to salute the hearth,
          to the shelf that served as chapel, to bid farewell to the
          ancestral gods, to the wax forefathers in the hall, then to kiss
          her mother, finally to turn, kneel and embrace the doorposts of the
          paternal dwelling, and kiss the threshold from which she
          parted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without, the
          procession waited. She was gently disengaged from her mother’s
          arms, and to the cries of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Talasse!</span></span>
          amidst a shower of walnuts thrown among the boys by the bridegroom,
          the procession started.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          attended by three lads, one went before carrying a torch, the other
          two walked, one on each side, carrying spindle and distaff. The
          torch, according to rule, was of whitethorn wood, and on arrival at
          the house of the bridegroom would be scrambled for and ripped to
          pieces by the guests, as every shred was esteemed to carry good
          luck.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now rose a burst
          of song, the so-called Fescennian lays, some old and some new,
          accompanied by the flutes of musicians and the clash of castanets
          and cymbals of dancing girls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
          descended the hill to the Forum, crowds lining the way and shouting
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Feliciter</span></span>!</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a corner
          there was a little clearing, for there lay a pallet, and on it a
          sick woman, who had been brought from her dwelling to see the
          sight. She extended and waved her hand, holding something as
          Domitia approached, and the bride through her tears noticed her,
          halted, went towards her, and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Glyceria! you here to wish me happiness!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And to give thee, dear lady, a little
          present.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She extended to
          her a small amulet, that Domitia accepted gratefully, and stooping
          kissed the paralyzed woman on the brow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An unheard-of
          thing! unparalleled! A thing she would not have done, had she been
          in full control over herself—a thing she would not have done, had
          not her heart brimmed with love for all, at that moment. She, a
          noble lady, belonging to one of the greatest houses in Rome, kissed
          a poor actor’s wife, an enfranchised slave—and that before all
          eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About Glyceria
          was a dense throng of men and women and children, the occupants of
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Island”</span> in which she lived. It
          was they, who, pitying her sufferings, desirous that she should see
          the procession, had opened a space before her, and held it open,
          that none might impede a full view of the marriage train.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this throng
          of rude artisans, shoemakers, cordwainers, leather-sellers, hawkers
          and their wives and children saw this act of Domitia. For a moment
          they were silent, and then they broke into a roar of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Feliciter! feliciter! the Gods be with thee, dear
          lady! The Gods protect thee! The Gods shower blessings on
          thee!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Domitia
          might not tarry; confused, half ashamed of what she had done, half
          carried off her feet by the thrill of joy that went from the crowd
          to her, she advanced.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
          182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The train
          descended by the lake of Nero, now occupied by the Colosseum, then
          ascended the Celian Hill to the house of Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching his
          door, the procession spread out, and gave space for the bride to
          advance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Modestly,
          trembling with love, timidity, hope in her heart, she anointed the
          doorposts with oil and then passed woollen strings round them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
          accomplished, two young men started forward, caught her up, made a
          seat for her of their hands, and bore her over the threshold, which
          she might not touch with her feet, lest by accident or nervousness
          she should stumble, and so her entry into the new house be
          ill-omened. On being admitted into the habitation of her husband,
          it was her duty to go to the hearth and make up the fire, then to
          the fountain and draw water; next to worship the household
          gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house was
          pretty. It had been fresh painted, and was bright with color, and
          sweet with flowers, for every pillar was wreathed and each door
          garlanded. Numerous lamps illumined the chambers, and in the atrium
          were reflected in the water tank. The air was vibrating with music,
          as choirs sang Fescennian songs, and timbrels tinkled and pipes
          twittered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          received by the wife of L. Ælius Lamia, who had adopted Domitia’s
          husband. He was a quiet man, who had no ambition, had taken no
          offices, and had passed his time in taming birds. He was the son of
          a better known man, who had been a friend of Horace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old woman,
          gentle in manner, took Domitia by the hand and led her into the
          tablinum, where was old Lamia, a cripple through gout, and he
          kissed the girl, patted her hands and spoke an affectionate
          welcome.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg
          183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Claudia and I,”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“were childless and so we adopted Lucius. He has been a
          good son to us, and this is a happy day to all three,—to him who
          has secured the sweetest flower of Rome, and to Claudia and me who
          obtain so good a daughter. But, ah! we are old and have our humors,
          I, with my gout, am liable to be peevish. You must bear with our
          infirmities. You will have a worthy husband, one cut out of the old
          rock of which were the ancient Romans, and not of the Tiberine mud
          of which the present generation are moulded.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come now,”</span> said the old woman, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the guests are about to depart, bid them
          farewell.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she led the
          young girl back into the atrium.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There stood the
          Chaldæan, dark, stern, ominous.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia in
          exuberant joy smiled at him, and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Elymas! You see my happiness. Isis has for once been
          in error—we, my Lamia and I, are united, and there have been no
          hands thrust forth to part us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My lady,”</span> said the astrologer, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the day is not yet over.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And the auguries were all propitious.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The promise of the augurs may not jump with thy
          desire,”</span> he replied.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had no time
          for more words, as her hand was caught by L. Ælius Lamia, who drew
          her aside into the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lararium</span></span> or chapel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dearest,”</span> he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“this is a day of trial to thee—but we shall be left
          undisturbed shortly. The guests depart and the riot will
          cease.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked at
          him, with eyes that brimmed with tears, and a sob relieved her
          heart, as she cast herself on his breast and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A rumor, none
          knew from whom it arose, spread rapidly in whispers, sending a
          quiver of alarm, distress, pity, through the entire wedding party,
          reaching last of all him most concerned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">None dared
          breathe in his ear what all feared; but none would separate till it
          was surely ascertained whether what was surmised was a fact or
          not.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slaves knew
          it and looked wistfully at Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was engaged
          in making trifling presents to the many guests and well-wishers,
          moving from one to another, attended by slaves with trays piled up
          with gifts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus burst
          on him, through the throng, forgetting, in his agitation and fear,
          the diffidence that belonged to his position.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir! Where is the mistress?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia, without
          looking at him, or desisting from what he was about, answered:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Within, being freed from her veil and bridal
          ornaments.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir! Lucius! she has been stolen from you! she has
          been carried away.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia stood as
          one petrified.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How dare you utter such a
          jest?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg
          185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is no jest—she has been conveyed hence. She is not
          in your house.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without another
          word, Lamia flew into the portion of the house to which Domitia had
          retired.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There all was in
          confusion. The female slaves were either struck down with terror,
          or crying out that they were not to blame.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where is she?”</span> asked Lamia, hardly realizing
          that there was actual loss, thinking this was some frolic of his
          young companions, who on such occasions allowed themselves great
          licence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To add to the
          confusion, a tame magpie with clipped wing, belonging to the gouty
          old Lamia, got in the way of every one, and screamed when run over;
          and the elder man roared out reproach and brandished his crutch
          when the life of his pet was endangered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Claudia, like a
          pious woman, had rushed to the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lararium</span></span> to supplicate the
          assistance of the Gods, especially of Lamius, son of Hercules and
          Omphale, the reputed half-divine ancestor of the family.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia had
          disappeared.—How?—none could say. She had been spirited away, one
          said in this manner, another said in that. One held it as his
          opinion that she had been carried off by some disbanded Vitellian
          soldiers who were said to lurk about the suburbs of Rome and commit
          depredations. Some thought that in maiden shyness she had fled
          home; some whispered that the Gods had translated her; others that
          a former lover had suborned the servants to admit him, and that he
          had conveyed her from her husband’s house to his own.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in what
          direction had she been taken? There again opinions differed, and
          tongues gave conflicting <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
          186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>accounts. One had seen a litter hurried down
          the <a name="corr186" id="corr186" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Clivus</span>
          Scauri. One declared that he had seen a girl running in the
          direction of Nero’s lake, and suggested that this was Domitia who
          had gone thither to destroy herself. One had noticed
          suspicious-looking men wrapped in military cloaks lounging about,
          and these had disappeared—he had even seen the backs of some near
          the Porta Metrovia. Then one cried out:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What else can be expected when such an ill-omened bird
          is kept in the house, as a magpie?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not until all
          guests, visitors, had been excluded from the house, could anything
          be learned with certainty, and that was little. During the
          afternoon, shortly before the arrival of the procession, several
          male and female slaves had arrived under the direction of a
          Chaldæan soothsayer, who announced that he had been sent along with
          them to the house of the bridegroom by the bride’s mother, the Lady
          Duilia, and that they formed a portion of Domitia’s attendance, who
          had been associated with her in her former home, and would be about
          her person in her new quarters. No suspicion had been roused, and
          as the Magian spoke with authority, and gave directions, which it
          was presumed he was commissioned to do, and as old Lamia was
          crippled with gout and moreover indisposed to attend to such
          matters, and the old lady was simple to childishness, these
          strangers were suffered to do much what they pleased; and on the
          bride retiring to be divested of the flame colored veil, her wreath
          and other ornaments, had been allowed to take possession of
          her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What happened
          further they did not know. In the excitement of the arrival of
          visitors nothing had been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg
          187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>observed till some of the household servants
          remarked that the servants of the family of Duilia had left,—that
          there had been a bustle in the garden court, and that a litter had
          departed, borne by men who ran under their load. But even then no
          notion that the bride had been carried off was entertained. For
          some time no suspicion of mischief arose. When the slaves became
          aware that their new mistress was no longer in the house, there was
          first some surprise entertained that she was not seen, then a
          notion that she might be unwell or over-tired—but the first word
          that suggested that she had been conveyed away came from without
          the house, from a guest who inquired casually what lady had left
          the house, in a litter, borne by trotting porters. Lamia, in
          violent agitation, at once hurried to the house whence Domitia had
          come, to ask for an explanation. There he <a name="corr187" id=
          "corr187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">learned</span> nothing satisfactory. No servants had
          been sent beforehand. Domitia had taken with her two female slaves,
          but they had attended her in the procession. The sorcerer, it was
          true, had disappeared and had not returned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia was
          obliged to return home, without his anxiety being in any way
          removed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching his
          palace on the Cœlian, he learned something further. In the room in
          which Domitia had been divested of her bridal ornaments, which lay
          scattered in disorder, was a crystal cup that contained the dregs
          of wine, and this wine was drugged with a powerful narcotic. Of
          this the slave who acted as house-surgeon and physician was
          certain. He had tasted it and detected the presence of an opiate.
          Nothing further could be learned, neither whence came the strange
          slaves nor whither they had gone.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the mean time
          a party surrounding a closed litter had passed through the Porta
          Capena, and was hurrying along the Appian Way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Directly the
          city was left, a tall man who directed the convoy called a
          halt;—then approaching the litter, he drew back the curtains, and
          said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Asleep! Two of you take her up, lift her, set her on
          her feet and rouse her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was obeyed
          and a helpless body was removed, sustained between two stout
          slaves, and made to stand on the causeway.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shake her,”</span> said the director, who was none
          other than the Chaldæan. <span class="tei tei-q">“If she sleep on,
          she will never wake. Roused and made to walk she must be. We need
          fear no pursuit. I have left those behind who will spread a false
          rumor, and send such as think she has been carried away along the
          wrong road. Make her walk.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The helpless
          girl—it was Domitia—staggered with drowsiness and stumbled.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let me sleep,”</span> she murmured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It must not be, lady. To let you sleep is to consign
          you to death. You must be constrained to walk.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let me sleep!”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-corr">she</span> fretfully said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If you sleep you die.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I want to die—only to sleep. I am dead
          weary.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Make her move along,”</span> said the sorcerer in a
          low tone, and the slaves who held her up drew her forward. She
          scarce moved her feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, you are cruel. I want to sleep. An hour! half an
          hour. For one moment longer!”</span> she pleaded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still the
          bearers drew her forward, they did not lift <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her so that she need not move her feet.
          She was constrained to step forward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I pray you! I will give you gold. You shall have all
          my jewels. Lay me down. Let go your hold, and I will lie where I
          am, and sleep.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Draw her further.—Hark! here come horses. Aside!
          behind that tomb!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The party stole
          from off the road and secreted itself behind one of the mausoleums
          that line the sides of the Appian Way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shake her—lest she doze off in your arms,”</span> said
          Elymas, and the slaves obeyed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          began to sob. <span class="tei tei-q">“Have pity! only for a little
          while, I am so tired. The day has been so long and so
          wearying.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They are passed—mere travellers,”</span> said the
          sorcerer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Into the road again. Force her
          to walk.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she called,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Lamia—my Lucius! come to me, drive these
          men away. They will not let me sleep,”</span> and she struggled to
          free herself, and unable to do so by a spasmodic effort, began to
          sob, and sobbed herself into a half doze.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She is sleeping. Run with her,”</span> called the
          Magus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In vain did she
          weep, entreat, threaten, naught availed, she was forced to advance;
          now to take a few steps, to rest on her feet, to walk in actuality.
          The very anger she felt at not being allowed to cast herself down,
          fold her hands under her head, and drop off into unconsciousness,
          tended to rouse her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After about half
          an hour, her entreaties to be allowed to rest became less frequent,
          and alternated with inquiries as to where she was, whither she was
          going, why she was forced to walk, and that at night. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then she ceased altogether to complain
          of drowsiness, and finding she met with no response to her
          inquiries as to her destination, she became silent; she was now
          conscious, but her brain was clouded, perplexed. She could remember
          nothing that would account for her present position. Whether she
          were in a dream, laboring under nightmare, she could not tell, and
          purposely she struck her foot against one of the paving blocks of
          lava, and by the pain assured herself that she was actually
          awake.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But where was
          she?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked up.
          The sky was besprent with stars, a sky limpid, tender, vaporless
          and vast, out of which the stars throbbed with iridescent light in
          all the changeful flicker of topaz, emerald and ruby. And the air
          was full of flying stars, in tens of thousands, they settled on
          rushes by the roadside in chains of fire, they flashed across the
          eyes, they settled down on the dress; and out of the cool grass
          shone the steady lustre of innumerable glow-worms.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The milky way,
          like an illumined veil, crossed the vault, vaporous, transparent
          with stars shining through it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the black
          monuments on each side hooted the owls, bats swept by, diving out
          of night to brush by the passers along the road and plunge back
          into night, like old forgotten fancies of the dreaming mind, that
          recur and vanish again, in waking hours. Out of the grass the
          crickets shrilled, and frogs called with flutelike tones at
          intervals, whilst others maintained an incessant chatter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where was she?
          What were these great fantastic edifices on each side of the road?
          They were no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg
          191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>houses, for out of none glimmered a light. No
          occupants stood in the doors, or sang and piped on the threshold.
          These were no taverns, for no host invited to rest within, and
          praised his fare. The road was forsaken, still as death, and these
          mansions were the dwellings of the dead. She knew this now—that she
          was on one of the roads that led from the gates of Rome, lined with
          tombs. How she had got there she knew not. Least of all did she
          know for what reason she was being dragged along it. She had thus
          trudged for a considerable time; she had ceased to speak. She was
          occupied with her thoughts. Weary she was, but in too great anguish
          of mind to be aware how weary she was, till tripping on a stone she
          fell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then a voice
          said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She is full awake now. There is naught to fear. Let
          her again mount the litter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Elymas!”</span> exclaimed the girl, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know you, I know your voice. What means this?
          Whither am I being taken?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam,”</span> said the sorcerer in reply, after a
          pause, <span class="tei tei-q">“your own eyes shall answer the
          question better than my lips, to-morrow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sleep-drunk,
          with clouded brain, eyes that saw as in a dream, feet that moved
          involuntarily, Domitia descended from the litter and tottered in at
          a doorway when informed that she had reached her destination.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where that was
          she did not care, whose house this was mattered nothing to her in
          her then condition of weariness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Female slaves
          bearing lights received her and directed her steps to a chamber
          where they would have divested her of her garments and put her to
          bed, had she not refused their assistance, thrown herself on the
          couch and in a moment fallen fast asleep.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slaves
          looked at each other, whispered, and resolved not to torment by
          rousing her; they accordingly drew the heavy curtains of the
          doorway and left her to her slumbers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But weary though
          Domitia was, her sleep was not dreamless, the song of a thousand
          nightingales that made the night musical reached her ears and
          penetrated the doorways of her troubled brain and wove fantasies;
          the ever-present sense of fear, not dissipated by slumber, weighed
          on her and gave sombre color to her dreams; the motion of the
          palanquin had communicated itself in her fancy, to the bed, and
          that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name=
          "Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tossed and swayed
          under her. Her weary feet seemed stung and burnt as though they had
          been held too close to the fire. Now she saw Lamia’s face, and then
          it was withdrawn; now her mother seemed to be calling to her from
          an ever-increasing distance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet troubled
          though her sleep was, it afforded her brain some rest, and she woke
          in the morning at a later hour than usual, when by the strip of
          warm light below the curtains she was made aware that the sun had
          risen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She started from
          sleep, passed her hand across her face, pressed her brows, stepped
          to the doorway, pushed the curtains aside and looked out into a
          little atrium, in which plashed a fountain, and where stood boxes
          of myrtles in full flower, steeping the atmosphere with
          fragrance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At once two
          female servants came to her, bowed low and desired permission to
          assist in dressing her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With some
          hesitation she consented.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where am I?”</span> she asked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the lake of Alba,”</span> answered a dark-faced
          servant with hard lustrous eyes, and in a foreign dialect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In whose house?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slaves
          looked at each other, and made no reply.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again she put
          the question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady, we are forbidden to say,”</span> answered one of
          the slaves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“At Alba?”</span> muttered Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as the
          woman divested her of her tunic, something fell from her bosom on
          the mosaic floor. The maid stooped, picked it up and handed it to
          Domitia, who turned it in her palm and looked at it, at first
          without comprehension. Then she recollected what <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this was—the amulet given her by
          Glyceria. It was a red cornelian fish pierced at one end and a fine
          gold ring inserted in the hole, so that the stone might be
          suspended.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was not
          in a condition of mind to pay attention to the ornament, but she
          bade one of the servants thread a piece of silk through the ring
          that she might wear the amulet about her neck, and then she allowed
          herself to be conducted to the bath.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With suspicious
          eyes the girl observed everything. She was obviously in a country
          villa belonging to some Roman noble, and that villa beside the
          Alban Lake.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ælii Lamiæ
          had no country-house at this place, of that she was aware. She had
          heard some of the friends of her mother speak of the beauties of
          the Alban Lake, and then her mother had lamented that the family
          estate lay by the Gabian puddle. But she could not recall that any
          one of them had a villa there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she left
          the bath she walked out of the doorway through the vestibule and
          stood on the terrace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Below was the
          sombre lake, almost circular, with the rolling woods of oak and
          beech flowing down the slopes to the very water’s edge, here and
          there the green covering interrupted by precipitous crags of tuffa.
          Yonder was the great ridge on which gleamed white the Temple of
          Jupiter Latiaris, the central shrine of the Latin races, the great
          pilgrimage place to which the country people turned in every
          distress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had not
          previously seen the Alban Lake, although Gabii had been her
          residence for some months, and that was seated on a low spur of the
          mountains, in the crater of one of which slept this tranquil and
          lovely sheet of water. But she knew enough about it by <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hearsay to be sure that she was not
          misinformed by the slaves as to where she now was. She certainly
          was beside that lake, near which once stretched Alba Longa, the
          cradle of the Roman race—a race of shepherds driven from its first
          seat by volcanic fires, to settle beside the Tiber on the Palatine
          Hill.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That road along
          which she had been conveyed during the night was the great Appian
          Way. It could have been none other, and that led, as she was aware,
          along the spurs of the Alban mountains.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She walked the
          terrace, her brow moist with anxious thought.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why had she been
          carried off?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By whom had she
          been swept as by a hurricane from her husband’s side?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sense of
          numbness was on her brain still, caused by the shock. To Lucius
          Lamia her heart had turned with the reverence she had borne to her
          father, with the sweetness and glow of girlish love for one who
          would be linked with her by a still nearer tie. She could not
          realize that she was parted from Lamia finally, irrevocably. She
          was in a waking dream: a dream of great horror, but yet a dream
          that would roll away and reality would return. She would wake from
          it in the arms of her dear husband, looking into his eyes, clinging
          to his heart, hearing his words soothing her mind, allaying her
          terrors.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If at this time
          she could have conceived that to be possible which nevertheless was
          to take place, she would have run to the lake and plunged into its
          blue waters.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Singularly
          enough no thought of the vision in the temple of Isis recurred to
          her. Possibly she was in too <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>stunned a condition of mind; possibly the
          effects of the narcotic still hung about her, like the vapors that
          trail along the landscape after a storm of rain at the break of the
          weather. No thought of hers connected this outrage with Domitian.
          This was due to the impression produced in her by conversation with
          her mother, who, she believed, was designing to secure <a name=
          "corr196" id="corr196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">Domitian</span> for herself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
          young prince had never shown her any favor. He had studiously
          neglected her, that he might address himself to Duilia. He had
          taunted her, sneered at her, but never spoken to her words that
          might be construed as a declaration of love. She recalled how she
          had urged her mother to expel him from the house when he sought
          refuge there; how she had sought to thrust him forth to certain
          death, to deny him the rights of hospitality. Such was enough to
          provoke resentment, not to awaken love. Her mother, on the other
          hand, had bound him to her by the tie of gratitude, for she had
          saved him at that time of extreme peril.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing the dark
          slave girl, Domitia signed to her to approach, and asked:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where are some of my family? Is not Euphrosyne here—or
          Eboracus?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady—none came with you save the servants of our
          master.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And he?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is that Magus, Elymas; send him to
          me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After some delay
          the sorcerer appeared, and approached, bowed and stood silent with
          hands crossed on his breast.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Elymas,”</span> said Domitia, <span class=

          this? Why have I been carried away to Albanum? By whose orders has
          this been done?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He bowed
          again—paused, and then, with obvious uneasiness in his manner
          replied:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days passed,
          and Domitia remained undisturbed. No tidings reached her from Rome,
          but to her great relief the Cæsar Domitian did not appear. That a
          meeting with him must take place, she was aware, but in what manner
          he would address her, that she could not guess; whether he would
          take occasion to exhibit ignoble revenge for her treatment of him
          on the night when he sought refuge in her house, or whether he

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She now followed
          with beating heart. Her cheeks were flushed, a sparkle was in her
          eye, her breath came fast through her nostrils, her teeth were
          set.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without were
          many lictors lining the way, filling the court.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He led into that
          portion of the villa where were the baths and entered the warm
          room. There Domitia saw at once Lamia, stripped almost to the skin,
          held <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name=
          "Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by soldiers of the
          prince’s guard, his mouth gagged, and a surgeon standing by with a
          razor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She would have
          sprung to him and thrown her arms around him, had she not been
          restrained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia,”</span> said the young Cæsar; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you will see how that to divorce you is in my power,
          unless you consent to it yourself, and give yourself to
          me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia trembled
          in every limb. She looked with distended eyes at Lamia, who had no
          power to speak, save with his eyes, and they were fixed on her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A large marble
          bath stood near, and both hot and cold water could be turned on
          into it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She knew but too
          well what the threat was. Seneca had so perished under Nero,—by the
          cutting of the veins he had bled to death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Petronius,
          master of the Revels to the same tyrant, had suffered in the same
          manner, and as his blood flowed he had mocked and hearkened to
          ribald verses till the power to listen and to flaunt his
          indifference were at an end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the
          second Nero, not yet full blown, but giving earnest of what he
          would be, was threatening Lamia with the same death. It was not a
          gradual and painless extinction, but a death of great suffering,
          for it led to agonizing cramps, knotting the muscles, and
          contracting the limbs. Domitia knew this—she had heard the dying
          agonies of Seneca and Petronius described,—and she looked with
          quivering lips and bloodless cheeks on him whom she loved best—on
          the only one in the world she loved, threatened with the same awful
          death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She would do
          anything short of taking the Cæsar Domitian as her husband in place
          of him to whom she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg
          207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>was bound by the most sacred ties,—anything
          short of that to save the life of Lamia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The struggle in
          her bosom was terrible; her head spun, she tried to speak but could
          frame no words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She sought some
          guidance in Lamia’s eyes, but her own swam with tears, and she
          could not read what he would advise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My child,”</span> said her mother, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“of course it is all very sad, and that sort of
          thing—but it is and must be so. If a wilful girl will not be
          brought to reason in any other way—well, it is a pity.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian turned
          to Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          I give his life to you on the one condition that you allow divorce
          to be pronounced between you and him, and that in his place you
          accept me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia turned
          her face away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“So be it,”</span> said he. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Surgeon, open his veins.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a slash of
          the razor across the arm at the fold, an artery was severed, and
          the black blood spurted forth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Uttering a cry
          of horror, Domitia battled with those who held her, to reach and
          clasp her husband.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cut the other arm,”</span> commanded the prince,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dramatic
          composer has this great advantage over the novelist, that when he
          has to allow for a certain amount of time,—it may be for years—to
          elapse between the parts of his play, he lowers the curtain, the
          first or second act is concluded, ices, oranges are taken round in
          the stalls; the orchestra strikes up an overture, the gentlemen
          retire to the promenade gallery for a cigar, and the ladies discuss
          their acquaintances, and the toilette of those in the boxes, after
          having explored the theatre with their glasses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Munich and
          Bayreuth, at the performance of Wagner’s operas, the space allowed
          between the acts is sufficient for a walk and for a meal. Thus the
          lapse of time between the parts of a drama is given a real
          expression, and the minds of those who have followed the first part
          of the story are prepared to accept a change in the conditions of
          the performers, such as could be brought about solely by the
          passage of time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a novelist
          has no such assistance, he is not able to produce such an illusion;
          even when his story appears in a serial, he is without this
          advantage, for the movement of his tale, when it is rapid, is
          artificially delayed by the limitations laid down by the editors of
          the magazines, and the space allotted to him, and when <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he does require a pause to allow for the
          gliding away of a certain number of years, that pause consists of
          precisely the same number of days as intervened in the serial
          publication, between chapters in which the action should have been
          continuous.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer must,
          therefore, throw himself on the indulgence of the reader, and plead
          to be allowed like a Greek chorus to stand forward and narrate what
          has taken place, during a period of time concerning which he
          proposes to pass over without detailed account, before he resumes
          the thread of his narrative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Vespasian
          was hailed Emperor by the troops he was aged sixty-one, and none
          supposed that his reign would be long. He associated his eldest son
          Titus with him in government, but would not allow the younger,
          Domitian, any power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Emperor
          reached the capital, he learned the misuse Domitian had made of
          that which he had arrogated to himself, or which had been granted
          to him by the Senate, in his father’s absence. The old Emperor was
          vastly displeased at the misconduct of his younger son, and would
          perhaps have dealt severely with him, had he not been dissuaded
          from so doing by Titus, who pointed out, that as he himself had no
          son, in all probability Domitian would at some time succeed to the
          purple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man,
          kept in the background, not even allowed the command in any
          military expedition, carefully watched and restrained from giving
          vent to his natural disposition, chafed at his enforced inactivity,
          and at the marked manner in which he was set behind his elder
          brother, a man who, by the capture of Jerusalem, had gained a name,
          and had attached the sol<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
          210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>diery to him. Domitian was known to the
          military only by his abortive attempt to pluck the laurels in
          Germany from the brow of his kinsman Cerealis, for the adornment of
          his own head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian was
          granted none of the titles that indicated association in the
          Empire. He was not suffered to take part in public affairs. His
          insolence in neglecting the duties of prætor of the city, as
          beneath his dignity, was punished in this manner. When Titus
          celebrated his triumph after the Jewish war, with unusual
          magnificence, he and his father rode in chariots of state, but
          Domitian was made to follow on horseback. When Vespasian and his
          eldest son showed themselves in public, they were carried on
          thrones, whereas Domitian was made to attend in the rear in a
          litter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The envious,
          ambitious young prince, under this treatment was driven to wear a
          mask, and he affected a love of literature, and indifference to the
          affairs of state. Titus, who knew less of him than his father, was
          deceived, but Vespasian was too well aware of the radically evil
          heart of his younger son to trust him in any way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          unable to escape from compulsary association with this imperial
          cub. Vespasian was unwilling to undo the past, and have the scandal
          raked up again, and public attention called to it. The minds of the
          volatile Romans had forgotten the circumstances and were occupied
          with new matters of gossip. Domitian married Domitia Longina, and
          the old Emperor after some consideration concluded that she should
          remain his wife.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          relations between her and the prince were <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>strained. She hated him for what he had done,
          and she made no attempt to affect a liking she did not feel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lamia remained
          unmarried; he had cared for no other woman, and he felt that there
          was not to be found one who could ever be to him what he had hoped
          Domitia would have proved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once Titus asked
          him his reason for not marrying.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why do you inquire?”</span> said Lamia, with a bitter
          smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you also wish to carry off my
          wife?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the death of
          the old Emperor, Titus succeeded without any difficulties being
          raised. His father had already associated him in the Empire and had
          gradually transferred the conduct of affairs to his hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto the
          brothers had lived on very good terms with each other, at all
          events in appearance, and Domitian had been sufficiently prudent to
          veil his jealousy of Titus, who had shown himself kindly disposed
          towards his younger brother.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the accession
          of Titus, Domitian hoped to be associated with him in government in
          the same manner as Titus had been with his father. In this he was
          disappointed, his disappointment got the better of his prudence,
          and he declared that his brother had falsified the will of
          Vespasian, who had divided the power equally between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the first day
          of his reign, Titus designated Domitian as his successor, but he
          allowed him no independent power; and the young prince at once
          involved himself in intrigues and sought to rouse the troops to
          revolt, and to proclaim him in place of Titus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condition of
          Domitia would have been more intolerable than it was, but that
          Vespasian, up to his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
          212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>death, retained his younger son about his
          person, in Rome, and it was but rarely that the prince was able to
          escape to his villa, at Albanum, where Domitia remained in
          seclusion. And his visits there were not only few and far between,
          but also brief.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was in bad
          humor when there, at liberty to vent his irritation at the manner
          in which he was treated by his father, and the behavior towards him
          of Domitia was not calculated to dispel his vapors.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A considerable
          change had come over her face. The expression had altered; it had
          been full of sweetness, and the muscles had been flexible. Now it
          was hard-set and stern.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian cursed
          her for the fascination she still exercised over him. It was
          perhaps her unyielding temper, her openly expressed scorn, and her
          biting sarcasms which stung him to maintain his grip on her,
          knowing that this was to her torture. Yet her beauty exercised over
          him a hold from which he could not escape. His feelings towards her
          were a mixture of passionate admiration and savage resentment. From
          every one else he met with adulation, or at least respect, from her
          neither. His will was a law to a legion of sycophants, to her it
          was something she seemed to find a pleasure in defying.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia nursed
          her resentment, and this soured her nature and reflected itself in
          her features.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the long
          Chiaramonte Gallery of the Vatican Museum is an exquisite and
          uninjured bust of Domitia Longina as a girl; the face is one that
          holds the passer-by, it is so sweet, so beautiful, so full of a
          glorious soul.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Florence
          Gallery is one of the same woman <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>after Domitian had snatched her away from
          Lamia, and hidden her in his Alban villa. Lovely the face is still,
          but the beautiful soul has lost its light, the softness has gone
          out of the face, and the shadow of a darkened life broods over
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Albanum the
          solitary Domitia had the satisfaction of being attended by her
          servant Euphrosyne, and the faithful Eboracus was also allowed to
          be there as her minister.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She occasionally
          visited her mother in Rome, but the chasm between them widened.
          Duilia could not understand her daughter’s refusal to accept the
          inevitable and failure to lay hold of her opportunities, and, as
          she termed it, <span class="tei tei-q">“eat her rat.”</span> The
          older Duilia grew, the less inclined she was to acknowledge her
          age, and the more frivolous and scheming she became. She was never
          weary of weaving little webs of mystery and of contriving plans;
          and the initiating of all these was a supper. She was well off,
          liked ostentation, yet was withal of a frugal mind, and never
          ordered costly dishes, or broached her best wine without
          calculation that they would lead to valuable results.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was possible
          that Vespasian might have interfered in favor of Domitia, had he
          been made to understand how strongly she disliked the union, but
          Domitia herself was never able to obtain an interview with the aged
          Emperor, and Duilia took pains to assure him that the marriage had
          been contracted entirely with her approval, that the union with
          Lamia had been entered on without feeling on either side, in
          obedience to an expressed wish of Corbulo before his death, and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The period was
          not one in which the personal feel<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          much thought, certainly not of being considered by an Emperor, and
          Vespasian took no steps to relieve Domitia. Titus was better aware
          of the facts, and had some notion of the wrench it had been to the
          young married people, but he was not desirous of having the matter
          reopened. It would not conduce to the credit of the Flavian house,
          and that was in his eyes a matter of paramount consideration—as the
          process of deification of the Flavians had already begun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What can I do for thee, Domitia?”</span> asked Titus,
          who was pacing the room; he halted before the young wife of his
          brother, who was kneeling on the mosaic floor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had taken
          advantage of her introduction into the Imperial palace to make an
          appeal to Titus, now Emperor. She had not been allowed to appear
          there during the reign of Vespasian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Titus was a
          tall, solidly built man, with the neck of a bull; he had the same
          vulgarity of aspect that characterized both his father and brother,
          and which was also conspicuous in his daughter Julia. The whole
          Flavian family looked, what it was, of ignoble origin,—there was
          none of the splendid beauty that belonged to Augustus, and to the
          Claudian family that succeeded. Their features were fleshy and
          coarse, their movements without grace, their address without
          dignity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If they
          attempted to be gracious, they spoiled the graciousness by
          clumsiness in the act; if they did a generous thing, it carried its
          shadow of meanness trailing behind it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Titus had not
          borne a good character before his elevation to the purple. He had
          indulged in coarse vices, had shown himself callous toward human
          suffering. Yet there was in his muddy nature a spark of good
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name=
          "Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feeling, a desire to
          do what was right, a rough sense of justice and much family
          affection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a
          disappointment to him that he had but one child, a daughter, a
          gaunt, stupid girl, big-boned, amiable and ugly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He knew that
          Domitian, his younger brother, would in all probability succeed
          him, but he also was childless. Next to him, the nearest of male
          kin, were the sons of that Flavius Sabinus, who had been butchered
          by the Vitellians, and their names were Sabinus and Clemens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The former was
          much liked by the people, he was an upright grave man. The second
          was regarded with distrust, as a Christian. It was not the fact of
          his following a strange religion that gave offence. To that Romans
          were supremely indifferent, but that which they could not
          understand and allow was a man withdrawing himself from the public
          service, the noblest avocation of a man, because he scrupled to
          worship the image of the Emperor, and to swear by his genius. They
          regarded this as a mere excuse to cover inertness of character, and
          ignobility of mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the like
          reason, Christians could not attend public banquets or go to
          private entertainments as the homage done to the gods, and the
          idolatrous offerings associated with them, stood in their way. The
          profession of Christianity, accordingly, not only debarred from the
          public service, but interfered with social amenities. Such
          withdrawal from public social life the Romans could not understand,
          and they attributed this conduct to a morbid hatred entertained by
          the Christians for their fellow-men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The public shows
          were either brutal or licentious. The Christians equally refused to
          be present at the gladiato<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
          217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>rial combats and at the coarse theatrical
          representations of broad comedy and low buffoonery. This also was
          considered as indicative of a gloomy and unamiable spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were
          indeed heathen men who loathed the frightful butchery in the arena,
          such was the Emperor Tiberius,—and Pliny in his letters shows us
          that to some men of his time they were disgusting, but nevertheless
          they attended these exhibitions, as a public duty, and contented
          themselves with expressing objection to them privately. The
          objection was founded on taste, not principle, and therefore called
          for no public expression of reprobation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clemens was
          quite out of the question as a successor. If he was too full of
          scruple to take a prætorship, he was certainly unfit to be an
          emperor. Not so Flavius Sabinus his elder brother. Him accordingly,
          Domitian looked upon with jealousy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What can I do for thee?”</span> again asked Titus, and
          his heavy face assumed a kindly expression; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my child, I know that thou hast had trouble and art
          mated to a fellow with a gloomy, uncertain humor; but what has been
          done cannot be undone——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Pardon me,”</span> interrupted Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it is that I desire; let me be separated from him. I
          never, never desired to leave my true husband, Lamia, I was
          snatched away by violence—let me go back.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What! to Lamia! That will hardly do. Would he have
          thee?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tainted by union with Domitian, perhaps not!”</span>
          exclaimed Domitia fiercely. <span class="tei tei-q">“Right
          indeed—he would not.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay,”</span> said Titus, his brow clouding,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“such a word as that is impious, and in
          another would be trea<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg

          heard my brother say as much. But I cannot think that Lamia would
          dare to receive thee again after having been the wife of a Flavian
          prince.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia’s lip
          curled, but she said nothing. These upstart Flavians made a brag of
          their consequence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“let
          me go to my old home at Gabii. I have lived in seclusion enough at
          Albanum to find Gabii in the current of life—and my mother and her
          many friends will come there anon. Let me go. Let there be a
          divorce—and I will go home and paddle on the lake and pick flowers
          and seek to be heard of no more.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It would not do for you and Lamia to be married again.
          It would be a political error; it might be dangerous to us
          Flavians.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I should have supposed, in your brand-new divinity
          that a poor mouse like myself could not have scratched away any of
          the newly-laid-on gold leaf.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia,”</span> said Titus, who had resumed his walk,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“be careful how you let that tongue act—it
          is a file, it has already removed some of the gilding.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A smile broke
          out on his face at first inclined to darken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There! There!”</span> said he, laughing; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am not a fool. I know well enough what we were, as I
          feel what we have become. Caligula threw mud, the mud of Rome, into
          the lap of my grandfather, because he had not seen to the efficient
          scouring of the streets. It was ominous—the soil of Rome has been
          taken away from the divine race of Julius—and has been cast into
          the lap of us money-lenders, pettyfogging attorneys of Reate. Well!
          the Gods willed it, Domitia—it is necessary for us to make a
          display.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
          219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Push, as my mother would say.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well—push—as you will it. But, understand, Domitia,
          though I am not ignorant of all this, I don’t like to have it
          thrown in my teeth; and my brother is more sensitive to this than
          myself. Domitia, I will do this for you. I will send for him, and
          see if I can induce him to part from you. I mistrust
          me,”</span>—Titus smiled, looked at Domitia, with one finger
          stroked her cheek, and said,—<span class="tei tei-q">“By the Gods!
          I do not wonder at it. I would be torn by wild horses myself rather
          than abandon you, had I been so fortunate——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sire, so wicked——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, well! you must excuse Domitian. Love, they say,
          rules even the Gods, and is stronger than wine to turn men’s
          heads.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He clapped his
          hands. A slave appeared. <span class="tei tei-q">“Send hither the
          Cæsar,”</span> he ordered. The slave bowed and withdrew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian entered
          next moment. He must have been waiting in an adjoining
          apartment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come hither, brother,”</span> said Titus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have a suppliant at my feet, and what suppose you
          has been her petition?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian looked
          down. He had a pouting disdainful lip, a dogged brow, and eyes in
          which never did a sparkle flash; but his face flushed readily, not
          with modesty, but shyness or anger.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Brother,”</span> said Domitian, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know well enough at what she drives. From the
          moment, the first moment I knew her, she has treated me to quip and
          jibe and has sought to keep me at a distance. I know not whether
          she use a love-philtre so as to hold me? I know not if it be her
          very treatment of me which makes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          turning of a hair whether I love or hate her most. I know what is
          her petition without being told, and I say—I refuse
          consent.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Listen to what I have to propose,”</span> said Titus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and do not blurt out your family quarrels
          before I speak about them. It is not I only, but all Rome, that
          knows that your life together is not that of Venus’s doves. It is
          unpleasant to me, it detracts from the dignity of the Flavian
          family”</span>—he glanced aside at his sister-in-law, and his lips
          quivered, <span class="tei tei-q">“that this cat-and-dog existence
          should become the gossip of every noble house, and a matter of
          tittle-tattle in every wine-shop. Make an end to it and repudiate
          her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian kept
          his eyes on the floor. Domitia looked at him for his answer with
          eagerness. He turned on her with a vulgar laugh and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Vixen! I see thee—naught would give thee greater joy
          than for me to assent. I should see thee skip for gladness of
          heart, as I have never seen thee move thy little feet since thou
          hast been with me! I should hear thee laugh—and I have heard no
          sound save flout from thee as yet. I should see a sun dance in
          thine eyes, that perpetually lower or are veiled in tears. Is it
          not so?”</span>—He paused and looked at her with truculence in his
          face—<span class="tei tei-q">“and therefore, for that alone, I will
          not consent.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking
          furtively out of the corners of his eyes, he saw a flash of hope in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He held up his
          head, and looking with leaden eyes at his brother, said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian turned
          about, and made a tiger-like leap at Domitia and catching her by

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian had
          been accorded by his brother a portion of the palace of Tiberius on
          the Palatine Hill, that was crowded with imperial residences; and
          Domitia had been brought there from Albanum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was one day
          on the terrace. The hilltop was too much encumbered with buildings
          to afford much space for gardens, but there were platforms on which
          grew cypresses, and about the balustrades roses twined and poured
          over in curtains of flower. Citrons and oleanders also stood in
          tubs, and against the walls glistened the burnished leaves of the
          pomegranate; the scarlet flowers bloomed in spring and the warm
          fruit ripened till it burst in the hot autumn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia, seated
          beside the balustrade, looked over mighty Rome, the teeming forum,
          roofs with gilded tiles of bronze, lay below her, flashing in the
          sun, and beyond on the Capitol, white as snow, but glinting with
          gold, was the newly completed temple of Jupiter, rebuilt in greater
          splendor than before since the disastrous fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hum of the
          city came up to her as the murmur of a sea, not a troubled one, but
          a sea of a thousand wavelets trifling with the pebbles of a beach,
          and dancing in and out among the teeth of a reef; a hum not unlike
          that of the bees—but somewhat louder, and pitched on a lower
          note.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
          223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia paid no
          attention to the scene, nor to the sounds, she was engaged with her
          jewel-box, that she had brought forth into the sun, in order that
          she might count over her treasures.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a respectful
          distance sat Euphrosyne spinning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia had some
          Syrian filagree gold work in her hand—it formed a decoration for
          the head, to be fastened by two pins; the heads were those of owls
          with opals for eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She laid it
          aside and looked at her rings and brooches. There was one of the
          latter, a cameo given her by her mother, of coral of two hues, a
          Medusa’s head, a beautiful work of art. Then she took up a necklace
          of British pearls from the Severn, she twisted it about her arm and
          lovely were the pure pearls against her delicate flesh,—like the
          dainty tints on the rose and white coral of the brooch she had laid
          aside.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She replaced the
          chain, and took up a cornelian fish.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Euphrosyne,”</span> said Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“come hither! observe this fish. Thy sister gave it me
          the day I was married, but alack! it brought me no luck. Think you
          it is an omen of ill? But Glyceria would not have given me one
          such.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, lady, the fish brings the greatest
          happiness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What is its meaning? It is a strange symbol. It must
          have some purport.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slave
          hesitated about answering.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, hearing
          steps on the pavement, and looking round, Domitia
          called—<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou! Elymas! who pretendest to
          know all things, answer me this, I have an amulet—a fish—what doth
          it portend?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What?—the murex? That gives the imperial

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bah! It is no murex, not a sea snail but a fish. What
          is the signification?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady, to one so high, ever-increasing
          happiness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Away! you are all wrong. Happiness is not where you
          deem it. False thou art, false to thy creed. <span class=

          Father of Light, quivering, battling, straining to escape out of
          its earthly envelope and soar to its source!—thou speak of this,
          and in all thy doings and devisings seekest what is sordid and
          dark!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gloomy man
          folded his cloak about him, and looking at her from under his
          penthouse brows answered:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou launchest forth against me without reason.
          Knowest thou what is a comet? It is a star that circles about the
          sun and from it drinks in all the illumination it can absorb, like
          as the thirsty soil in summer sucks in the falling rain, or the
          fields the outflow of the Alban Lake; then it flies away into
          space, and as it flies it sheds its effulgence, becoming ever more
          dim till it reaches infinite darkness and is there black in the
          midst of absolute nigritude. Then it turns and comes back to
          replenish its urn.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that can never be. When all light is gone, then all
          desire for return goes likewise. I know that in myself—I—I am such
          a comet. When I was a child I longed, I hungered for the light, and
          in my days of adolescence it was the same, only stronger—it was as
          a famine. I was the poor comet sweeping up towards my sun; but
          where my sun was, that—in the vast abyss of infinity—I knew not. I
          sought and found not, I sought and shed my glory, till there was
          but a faint glimmer left in me; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and now—now all light is extinguished, and
          with it desire to know, to love, to be happy, to
          return.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, you, as the comet, are reaching your apogee,
          your extreme limit; you must shed all your light before you can
          return to the source of light.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What! is that your philosophy? The Father of Light
          sends forth his ray to expire in utter darkness, predestined this
          ray of light to extinction. If so—then He is not good. And
          yet,”</span> she sighed, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is so. I am
          such. In blackness of night. Look you, Elymas, when I was a child,
          I laughed and danced; I cannot dance, I can but force a laugh now.
          I once loved the flowers and the butterflies; I love them no more.
          My light is gone. The faculty of enjoyment is gone with it. Do I
          want to return? To what? To the source of light that launched me
          into this misery? No, not into that cold and cruel fate. Let me go
          on my inky way, I have no more light to lose—I look only to go out
          as a fallen star and leave nothing behind me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What! when a great future is before you?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What future? you have none to offer me that I value.
          Away with your hints concerning the purple—it is the sable of
          mourning to me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She panted. The
          tears came into her eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is you who have wrecked my life—you—you. It was you

          loved—the only man with whom I could have been happy—whom
          I—”</span> she turned aside and hid her face. Then recovering
          herself, but with a cheek glistening with tears, she said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I admit it, I love still, and ever shall
          love. And he loves me. He has taken none to wife, for he thinks on

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Domitia, to stand on the soil that was turned by one’s forbears,

          they may have been yeomen, and one a commissioner, and another an
          usurer, and so on. They were honest men. Aye! the rate-collector,
          he was an honest man. Here all is false, and unreal, and—Domitia—I

          said,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I do not see that you need mope at

          the credit of being a very horse-leech to the province. But I can
          trust thee, little woman! There, no thanks, I seek mine own
          interest, and to protect our divine images and the new gilding from

          it is turning—it is drawing to the light—to hope. Happiness is
          near—ah!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In her
          excitement she had struck her jewel-case that stood on the marble
          balustrade, and sent it, with all its costly contents, flying down
          the precipice into the thronged lanes at the back of the forum in a
          glittering rain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“Now, for a while I am as one who has cast off a
          nightmare,”</span> said Domitia to herself. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is away—why he has attended Titus to the Sabine
          land I know not, unless the Emperor could not trust him in Rome—or
          may be, in his goodness he has done it to relieve me of his
          presence. I will go see my mother.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia ordered
          her litter and bearers. She had no trinkets to put on, save the
          fish of cornelian. Her mother liked to see her tricked out, and
          usually when Domitia paid her a visit she adorned herself to please
          the old lady,—now she could not assume jewelry as she had lost all
          her articles of precious stones and metal. So she hung the
          cornelian amulet about her neck.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a Roman
          lady went forth in palanquin, it was in some state. Before her went
          two heralds in livery, to clear the way and announce her coming at
          the houses where she purposed calling, then she had six bearers,
          and attendants of her own sex, carrying her scent bottles,
          kerchiefs, fans, and whatever she might think it possible she would
          require.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          impatient of display, but it had been imposed on her by the
          Emperor. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Flavians,”</span> said he
          smiling, <span class="tei tei-q">“must make a show in
          public.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Roman lady was
          at this period expected to wear yellow hair, if she would be in the
          fashion. Under the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
          230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Flavians, it was a compliment to the reigning
          princes to affect this color. It was true that the word <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">flavus</span></span> meant anything in color,
          from mud upwards to what might be termed yellow by courtesy. It was
          employed as descriptive of the Tiber, that was of the dingiest of
          drabs, and of the Campagna when every particle of vegetation was
          burnt up on it, and the tone was that of the dust-heaps. But now
          that the parsnip-haired Flavians were divine and all-powerful, the
          adjective was employed to describe the harvest field and gold.
          Ladies talked of their hair as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“flavan”</span> when it had been dyed with saffron and
          dusted with gold. Not to have yellow hair was expressive of
          disaffection to the dynasty—so every lady who would be in the
          fashion, and every husband who wanted office, first bleached and
          then dyed their hair, and as hair was occasionally thin, they
          employed vast masses of padding and borrowed coils from German
          <span class="tei tei-q">“fraus”</span> to make the utmost show of
          their loyalty to the august house of the divine Flavii.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia dared
          not be out of fashion, and she was constrained to submit to having
          her chestnut hair dredged with gold-dust before she went forth on
          her visit. For her, conspicuously to wear her hair in its natural
          color would at once have provoked animadversion, and been
          interpreted as a publication, in most defiant manner, of the
          domestic discord that was a topic of gossip in the saloons of
          Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she had
          entered her palanquin, she gave her orders and was carried lightly
          down the sloping road into the Forum. This was crossed, and then,
          drawing back the curtains of her litter, she said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Eboracus, tell the fellows not to go at once to the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name=
          "Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Carinæ. I have a
          fancy to see the wife of Paris the actor, in the <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Insula</span></span> of Castor and
          Pollux.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was playing
          with the fish suspended on her bosom, as she was being conveyed
          down the hill, and the thought had come to her that she had not
          seen Glyceria for a long time, and that now was a good occasion as
          her husband—whom these visits annoyed, and who had in fact
          forbidden them—was absent from Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The porters at
          once entered the narrow, tortuous lanes, where the lofty blocks of
          buildings cut off all sun and made twilight in midday.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Domitia
          stepped out of her litter, she saw coming down the street, a man
          much in the company of Domitian, for whom she entertained a
          particular dislike. He was a very dark man, and blind; his face was
          pointed, and his nose long; he ran with projecting head, turning
          his sharp nose from side to side, like a dog after game. His name
          was Valerius Messalinus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of his
          slaves whispered something into his ear, and he twisted about his
          head, and then came trotting in the direction of the litter of
          Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Quick,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          must go in; I will not speak with that man. If he asks for me, say
          I am out—out of the litter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She at once
          entered the block of lodgings, and impatiently waved back her
          heralds, who would have ascended the stairs before her and
          pompously announced her arrival.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking
          Euphrosyne along with her, Domitia made her way towards the
          apartments of the crippled woman. But already the news had spread
          that men in the im<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
          232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>perial livery had entered the building, and
          there was a rush to the balustrade to see them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Domitia
          reached the first landing, she saw that the women and children, and
          such men as were there, had ranged themselves on either side, to
          give her passage, every face was smiling, and lit with pleasure,
          the men raised their forefingers and thumbs to their mouths, and
          the women and children strove to catch her hand, or kneeling to
          touch, raise and kiss the hem of her dress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, at one time
          it had caused surprise that she a rich lady, should enter a common
          haunt of the poor, it was now a matter of more than surprise, of
          admiration and delight—to welcome the sister-in-law of the Emperor,
          one who it was whispered would some day be herself Empress,
          Augusta, and an object of religious worship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sort of
          welcome always went to the heart of Domitia, and gave her a choke
          in the throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great people
          never regarded the poor, save as nuisances. An emperor had said of
          the populace that it was a wolf he held by the ears. And it was
          wolf-like because brutally treated, pampered as to food given
          without pay, supplied with scenes of bloodshed, also without cost,
          in the arena, every encouragement to work taken from it, every
          demoralizing, barbarizing influence employed to degrade it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great people
          were supremely indifferent to the sufferings of the small, provided
          no hospitals for the poor who were sick, no orphanages for the
          homeless children—let them die—and the faster the better,—that was
          one wish of the great;—then shall we be alone on the earth with our
          slaves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Had these poor
          people hopes, ambitions, cares, sor<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>rows? Did they love their wives, and hold to
          their hearts their cubs of children? Did they have any desire that
          their children should grow up to be good men and virtuous women?
          Oh, no! such rabble were not of one blood with the rich. They had
          no fine feelings, they were like the beasts; they were without
          human souls; and so, when the poor died their bodies were rammed
          down wells contrived to contain a thousand corpses at a time, and
          then heaped over with a little earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Domitia had
          learned that it was not as supposed. Amidst the falsity, barbarity
          of heart, and coarseness of mind of such as were of the noble Roman
          order,—the cultured, the rich, the philosophic—there was no
          sincerity, no truth. She felt happier and better after one of these
          visits to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Insula</span></span> in the
          Suburra as though her lungs had inhaled a purer atmosphere. To the
          smiles and kisses and blessings lavished on her, she answered with
          kindly courtesy—and then stepped into the room of the paralyzed
          woman. Glyceria was as much a cripple as when first visited. She
          was more wasted—some time had passed—but she hardly seemed older,
          only more beautiful in her purity, a diaphanous lamp of
          mother-of-pearl through which shone a supernatural light.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia drew a
          deep sigh.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Glyceria,”</span> she said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when I come here, it is to me like seeing a glimpse of
          blue sky after a day of rain, or—like the scent of violets that
          came on me the first time I visited you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And when you, lady, come to me, it is as though a
          sunbeam shone into my dark chamber.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay—no flattery from thee, or I shall hate
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name=
          "Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thee. I get that till
          it cloys. But tell me now, times have been better, and why has not
          Paris moved into superior quarters? Surely he is in better employ
          and pay than of old.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is so, but only to a small degree,”</span> answered
          the actor’s wife. <span class="tei tei-q">“Paris performs in the
          grand old dramas in Greek only; in those of Æschylus and Eurypides
          and Sophocles, he is a tragic actor,—and—”</span> the poor woman
          smiled, <span class="tei tei-q">“perhaps home troubles have taken
          the laughter out of him. He is a sad bungler in comedy. Now the
          taste of Rome is not for the masterpieces of the ancients. The
          people clamor to see an elephant dance on a tight-rope, and a man
          crucified who pours forth blood enough to swamp the stage—the
          Laureolus! that is the piece to bring down the house. Or some bit
          of buffoonery and indecency. To that the people crowd. However, we
          live; I hang as a log about my Paris’s neck, but thank God, he
          loves his log and would not be rid of it, so I am
          content.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But if you will suffer me to assist you,”</span> said
          Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria shook
          her head. <span class="tei tei-q">“No, dear lady, do not take it
          ill if I refuse your kind offer, made, not for the first time. I am
          very happy here, very—with these dear kind people about me, running
          in and out all the day, offering their gracious good wishes,
          lending their ready help. On my word, lady! I do believe that they
          would all be in tears and feel it as a slight if I were to go; and
          for myself, I could never be happy away from them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia stood up
          and went to the door. Her heart swelled in her bosom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“None but the poor know,”</span> said the cripple,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“how kind, how tender the poor are to one
          another. Poverty is a brotherhood—we are all of one blood, and one
          heart.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And I—”</span> said the great lady, looking out on the
          balcony with its swarm of people, some busy, some idle, most
          merry—<span class="tei tei-q">“And I—”</span> said she,
          dreamily—<span class="tei tei-q">“I love the poor.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said a low firm voice, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“thou art not far from the Kingdom of
          Heaven.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She turned and
          started.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She recollected
          him, that stately man with deep, soft eyes. Luke, the
          Physician.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am not surprised,”</span> he added, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if you be His disciple,”</span> and he touched the
          cornelian fish.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not
          strange that in this splendid lady with golden hair he did not
          recognize the timid, crushed girl with auburn locks, he had seen on
          the Artemis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          recollection of that night came back with a rush like a tidal wave,
          over Domitia, and she threw forth the question, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why did you cut the thong?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He did not
          comprehend her. She saw it, and added, <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          do not recollect me. Do you not recall when we nearly ran down the
          galley of that monster Nero? On that night, we would have sent him
          to the bottom of the sea, but for you,—you spoiled it all; you cut
          the thong of the rudder. Why did you prevent us from doing
          it?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          the Lord. It was not for you to do it. You were not called to be

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          address, not indeed as one of the Brethren, but as a hearer and a
          seeker—enough—I was mistaken.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What means this fish?”</span> asked Domitia, her
          wounded pride oozing away at once. <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray
          you forgive me. I spoke hastily.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before he
          could offer any explanation, Paris appeared, his face expressive of
          alarm; he had seen the servants in the imperial white below, and
          knew therefore whom to find in his wife’s lodgings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hastily
          saluted her and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching the
          street, Domitia saw at once that the aspect of the populace was
          changed. Instead of the busy hum of trade, the calls of hucksters,
          the laugh of the mirthful, a stillness had come on every one; no
          face smiled, no voice was raised, scarcely any person moved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who had
          been bustling here and there stood motionless, trade had ceased. A
          sudden frost had arrested the flow of life and reduced all its
          manifestations to the lowest term. Such as had been running about
          collected in clusters, and conversed in whispers. Blank faces
          looked at Domitia as she entered her litter, with awed respect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Eboracus! What is the meaning of this?”</span> asked
          the lady.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, I know not. None will confide what they seem to
          know or to suspect.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Go forward,”</span> said she, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will visit my mother in the Carinæ. She will know
          everything.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another
          moment her train was in movement, and as she passed along, all
          bowed and saluted with their hands; they had done as much
          previously, but without the earnestness that was now observable. In
          the heart of Domitia was as it were a blade of ice transpiercing
          it. She was in deadly alarm lest her surmise should prove
          true.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg
          238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She would not
          draw the curtains of her litter, but looked at everything in the
          streets, and saw that all were in the same condition of
          stupefaction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching the
          entrance to the palace occupied by her mother, Domitia noticed
          another palanquin and attendants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Vestal Abbess, Cornelia, is with the Lady
          Duilia,”</span> said Eboracus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will go in!—I know her well, and esteem her,”</span>
          said Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She passed the
          vestibule, traversed the Atrium and entered the Tablinum. But Longa
          Duilia was not there. A slave coming up, said that she had entered
          with the Great Mother into a private apartment, where she might not
          be disturbed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well! I am no stranger. Lead the way.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another
          instant she was ushered into her mother’s presence, and at once
          Duilia bowed to her with profound respect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mother—what does this mean?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mother—I salute the Lady Cornelia—what is this that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The news are weighty, and concern you vastly, my

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is too horrible for me to think. Surely, surely,
          mother, it is false.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hearken, my dear,—Lady Cornelia, come also to the top
          of the house. It is a fine situation for seeing and hearing, and
          out of all reach of eavesdroppers. I hear shouts, I hear horns
          blowing. Come—speedily! let us to the house-top.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Laying hold of
          Domitia and the Vestal Superior by the wrists, she drew them with
          her to the roof.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The silence that
          had fallen on Rome had passed away, the town was now resonant with
          horns and trumpets pealing from the Prætorian camp, with the
          shouting of many voices from the same quarter. In the streets,
          messengers were running, armed with knotted sticks, and were
          hammering at the doors of Senators to summon them to an
          extraordinary meeting. The clash of arms resounded, so also the
          tramp of feet, as the city police marched in the direction of the
          Palatine. Here and there rose loud cries, but what they signified
          could not be judged.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another
          moment Eboracus came out on the housetop, and hastening to his
          mistress, said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, the Augustus—Titus, <span class=

          troops. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          hastening in cohorts to swear allegiance.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I congratulate you—I congratulate you with all my
          heart!”</span> exclaimed Longa Duilia, throwing her arms round her
          daughter. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have reached the summit of my
          ambition. I vow a kid to Febronia for her opportune—ahem!—but who
          would have thought the Roman fever would have been so speedy in

          luck. Run, Eboracus, summon the housekeeper; order the ancestral
          masks to be exposed, all the boxes opened, dust the noses with the
          feather brush; let the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lares</span></span>
          be garlanded. Tell Paulina to bring out the best incense, not the
          cheapest this time, and I vow I will throw a double pinch on the
          altar of the household gods. Who would have thought it! I—I, mother
          to an empress. I would dance on the house-top, but that my wig is
          not properly pinned, and might come off. I must, I positively must
          embrace you again, Domitia; and you too, Cornelia, I am so
          happy!—As the Gods love me! Wig pinned or not, I must
          dance.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let us go down,”</span> said Domitia in a hard
          tone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come down, by all means,”</span> acquiesced her
          mother. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must see that the Gods be
          properly thanked. I stepped this morning out of bed left leg

          some happiness would come to me to-day. As the Gods love me! I’ll
          give a little supper. Domitia! whom shall I invite? None of your
          second-class men now. There!—I thought as much; my wig has come
          off. Never mind! no men can see me, and women don’t
          count.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching the
          private apartment of the lady, Domitia said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mother—a word.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was white,
          save that a flame was kindled on each cheek-bone and her eyes
          scintillated like burning coals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Sabinus? I know that Domitian was alarmed at that. I saw it in his
          looks, I heard it in his voice; his movements of hand and foot
          proclaimed it. He feared a rival. He feared what the will of Titus
          might be—whom he might name as his successor. Mark me, my mother;
          the first to fall will be Flavius Sabinus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          there have been little unpleasantnesses. Man and wife do not always
          agree. Your poor father would not be ruled by me. If he had—ah
          me!—Things would have been very different in Rome. But he suffered
          for his obstinacy. You must be content to take things as you find
          them. Most certainly it would be better in every way if peacocks
          had eyes on both sides of their tails, but as they have not, only
          very silly peacocks turn about and expose the eyeless side. Make
          the best of matrimony. It is not many marriages are like young
          walnuts, that you can peel off the bitter and eat only the sweet.
          In most, the skin adheres so tightly that you have to take the
          sweet with the gall, and be content that there is any sweet at
          all.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia turned

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She said in a
          muffled voice:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady Cornelia, will you come with me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am at your service,”</span> answered the Vestal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ladies
          departed together, and at the portal each entered her own
          litter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To the Atrium Vestæ,”</span> said Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her retinue
          started, and a moment after followed that of the Vestal
          Cornelia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The streets were
          full of excited multitudes, currents running up one side, down
          another, meeting, coming to a standstill, clotting, and choking the
          thoroughfares, then breaking up and flowing again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it had not
          been for the liveries of the two heralds, the palanquin of Domitia
          could not have got through, but when it was observed whose litter
          and servants were endeavoring to make way, the crowd readily
          divided, and every obstacle gave way immediately. But the Vestal
          Superior needed not that the Cæsar’s wife should open the road for
          her. As much respect was accorded to her as to Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both trains, the
          one following immediately after the other, entered and traversed
          the Forum, passed the Temple of Julius, and at the south extremity
          reached the Atrium of the Vestal Virgins, a long building without a
          window, communicating with the outer world by a single door.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this door
          Domitia descended from her litter, and awaited the Abbess.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornelia also
          stepped from her litter. She was a tall and stately lady of forty
          years, who had once been beautiful, but whose charms were faded.
          She smiled—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“Time will never seem long in your sweet
          society,”</span> answered the Vestal and taking Domitia’s hand led
          her up the steps to the platform.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner was
          Domitia there, than she ran to the altar of the Goddess on which
          burned the perpetual fire, within a domed Temple, and clasped it.
          Cornelia had followed her, and looked at her with surprise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornelia became

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Romans
          were a pastoral people at Alba, then it was the duty of the young
          girls to attend to the common hearth and keep the fire ever
          burning. To obtain fresh fire was not always possible, and at the
          best of times not easy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fire was
          esteemed sacred, being so mysterious, and so indispensable, and
          reverence was made to the domestic hearth (hestia) as the altar of
          the Fire goddess.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Roman
          settlement was made on the banks of the Tiber, one hut of a
          circular form was constituted the central hearth, and provision was
          made that thence every household should obtain its fire. This hut
          became the Temple of Hestia or Vesta, and certain girls were set
          apart to watch the fire that it should never become
          extinguished.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was the
          origin of the institution of the Vestal Virgins, an institution
          which lasted from the founding of Rome in B.&nbsp;C. 753, to the
          disestablishment of Paganism, and the expulsion of the last Vestal,
          in A.&nbsp;D. 394, nearly eleven hundred and fifty years.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No girl under
          six or above ten years of age was admissible as priestess of the
          sacred fire, and but six damsels were allowed,—their term of
          service was thirty years, after which the Vestal was free to return
          home and to marry. The eldest of the Vestals was <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>termed Maxima, and she acted as superior
          or abbess over the community.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They enjoyed
          great possessions and privileges and were shown the most
          extraordinary respect. Seats of honor were accorded to the Vestals
          in the theatres, the amphitheatre and the circus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Vestals had
          other duties to perform beside that of maintaining the perpetual
          fire. They preserved the palladia of Rome, those mysterious
          articles on which the prosperity, nay, the very existence of the
          city was thought to depend. What these were was never known. The
          last Vestal carried them away and concealed them. With her death
          the secret was lost. Moreover, they took charge of the wills of
          great men, emperors and nobles, and in times of civil war they
          mediated between the conflicting parties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornelia gently
          detached the hands of Domitia from the altar of Vesta, and led her
          within the college of the Vestals, the only door to which opened on
          the platform on which stood the Temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On entering, she
          found herself in an oblong court surrounded on all four sides by a
          cloister, the prototype of those to be in later days erected in the
          several convents and abbeys, and collegiate buildings of
          Christendom. In the open space in the midst was the circular
          treasury of the palladia, at one end was the well whence the
          virgins drew their water. The cloister was composed of marble
          columns, and sustained an upper gallery, also open to the court but
          roofed over and the roof supported on columns of red marble.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between the
          columns below and above stood statues of the Superiors, who had
          merited commemoration. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>There was no garden, the place for walking was
          the cloister.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornelia
          conducted Domitia into the reception-chamber, and kissing her
          said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Under the protection of the Goddess you are
          safe.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I trust I in no way endanger your safety.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mine!”</span> Cornelia laughed. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is none above me save the supreme pontiff, and
          so long as I do no wrong, no one can molest me. But tell me—what
          wilt thou do?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the first place send out and bid my servants return
          home; and if they ask when to come for me, answer, when I send for
          them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That is easily done,”</span> said the Abbess. She
          clapped her hands and a slave girl answered and received this
          commission.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“now we
          come to the real difficulty. Here you are, but here you cannot
          tarry for long. For six days we may accord sanctuary, but for no
          more. After that we must deliver over the person who has taken
          refuge with us if required.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have for some time considered what might be done. I
          have been so miserable, so degraded, so impatient, that I have
          racked my brain how to escape, and I see but one course. When we
          were at Cenchræa, my mother and I, we were in the house of a Greek
          client of our family, who was very kind to us, and his wife loved
          me well. If I could escape thither in disguise, then I think he
          would be able to secrete me, there are none so astute as are the
          Greeks, and who so love to outwit their masters.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          that I am here in fulfilment of a vow, then no suspicion will be
          roused, and I can take my measures.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is not possible,”</span> said Cornelia in some

          his hand everywhere.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Vestal said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me have time to think this over—and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia
          remembered her resentment at the physician’s apparent

          I would cast myself on them, but two are slaves and the other is

          one may reach a condition of mind or soul, call it which you will,
          when we become desperate. One must make an effort to break away
          into a new and free and better life, or succumb and become bad, and

          see? I must away. I am lost to all good—if I remain. I must away!
          it is my soul that speaks, that spreads its hands to thee,
          Cornelia! save me!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She threw
          herself on her knees and extended her arms to the Vestal Abbess,
          caught her dress and kissed it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornelia was
          deeply moved,</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I beseech you, rise,”</span> she said, lifting the

          250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class=

          caressing her as a child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hearken to me, Domitia, I can think but of one person
          that can assist us; that is my cousin Celer. He is a good man, and
          whatever I desire, he will strive to execute as a sacred duty. Yet
          the risk is great.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I pray you!—I pray you get him to assist me to
          escape.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He must furnish you with attendants. It will not be
          secure for you to be accompanied by any of your own servants. They
          might be traced. Celer has got a villa. Stay, I will go forth at
          once and see him. He can give counsel. Do nothing till my
          return.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Vestal
          Great-Mother left, and Domitia was glad to be alone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The habitation
          of the Vestals was wonderfully peaceful, in the midst of busy,
          seething Rome, and in the centre of its greatest movement. As
          already said, it had no windows, and but one door that opened on
          the outer world. It drew all its air, all its light, from the patch
          of sky over the central court. Figures of Vestals glided about like
          spirits, and the white statues stood ghostlike on their
          pedestals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to be
          without flowers, without a peristyle commanding a landscape of
          garden and lake and trees and mountains! That was terrible. It
          would have been an unendurable life, but that the Vestal college
          was possessed of country seats, to which some of the elder of the
          sisterhood were allowed occasionally to go and take with them some
          one or two of the novices.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although there
          were no flowers in the quadrangle, there was abundance of birds. In
          and out among the variegated marbles, perching on balustrades,
          fluttering <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
          251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>among the statues, were numerous pigeons, as
          marbled in tint as the sculptured stonework, and looking like
          animated pieces of the same; and a tame flamingo in gorgeous
          plumage basked himself, then strutted, and on seeing a Vestal
          approach hopped towards her. When, moreover, the same maiden drew
          water from the well, the pigeons came down like a fall of snow
          about her, clustering round the bucket to obtain a dip and a
          drink.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several hours
          passed. At length the Abbess returned. She at once sought Domitia,
          who rose on her entry. Cornelia took both her hands within her own
          and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We women are fools, that is what Celer said, when I
          told him your plan. As he at once pointed out, it is impossible for
          you to lie hid anywhere in Italy—and impossible to escape from it,
          unknown to the Augustus. Any one endeavoring to assist you to
          escape would lose his life, most assuredly. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘I cannot sell smoke to a clown,’</span> said he
          bluntly—he is a plain man—<span class="tei tei-q">‘I will not put
          out a finger to assist in such an attempt, which would bring ruin
          on us all. But,’</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘this may
          be done; let the Lady Domitia retire to one of her own villas, in
          the country, and commit the matter to the Vestals. Your entreaty is
          powerful, and if attended by two of the sisters—or perhaps better
          alone, for this is not a matter to be made public—go to the prince,
          and plead in the lady’s name, that thou feelest unequal to the
          weight of duties that will now fall on the Augusta, and that thy
          health is feeble and thou needest repose and country air—then he
          may yield his consent, at least to a temporary retreat.’</span> But
          my kinsman Celer advised nothing beyond this. In very truth,
          nothing else can be done. Most men’s noses are crooked,—he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name=
          "Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said—and he is a
          blunt man—and those who have straight ones do not like to follow
          them. But in your case, Lady Domitia, there is practically no other
          way.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then I will to Gabii,”</span> said Domitia with a
          sigh. <span class="tei tei-q">“If he will force me back—there is
          the lake.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, said
          Cornelia, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost thou know that blind-man
          Messalinus?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Full well—he hangs on to the Cæsar Domitian, like a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Since thou didst enter the house of us Vestals, he
          hath been up and down the Via Nova and the Sacred Way, never
          letting this place out of his eye—blind though he be. Some say he
          scents as doth a dog, and that is why he works his head about from
          side to side snuffing the wind. When I went forth he detached two
          of his slaves to follow—and they went as far as myself and stood
          watching outside the door of the knight Celer, and when I came
          forth they were still there, and when I returned to the Atrium of
          Vesta, I found Messalinus peering with his sightless eyes round the
          corner. But, I trow, he sees through his servants’
          eyes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was at
          Gabii. Cornelia, the Vestal Great Mother had sent her thither in
          her own litter, and attended by her own servants, but with the
          assistance of the knight Celer, who had gone before to Gabii to
          make preparations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gabii had none
          of the natural beauties of Albanum, but Domitia cared little for
          that. It was a seat that had belonged to her father and here his
          ashes reposed. The villa was by no means splendid; but then—nor had
          been that of Albanum when she was first carried thither. Domitian
          had bought it immediately after the proclamation of his father, and
          it had then been a modest, but very charming country residence.
          Since then, he had lavished vast sums upon it, and had converted it
          into a palace, without having really improved it thereby. To
          Albanum he had become greatly attached; to it he retired in his
          moody fits, when resentful of his treatment by his father, envious
          of his brother, and suspicious of his first cousin Sabinus. There
          he had vented his spleen in harassing his masons, bullying his
          slaves, and in sticking pins through flies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if Gabii was
          less beautiful and less sumptuous, it had the immeasurable
          advantage of not being occupied by Domitian. There, for a while,
          Domitia was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg
          254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>free from his hateful society, his endearments
          and his insults, alike odious to her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And she enjoyed
          the rest; she found real soothing to her sore heart in wandering
          about the garden, and by the lake, and visiting familiar nooks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only into the
          temple of Isis she did not penetrate, the recollection of the
          vision there seen was too painful to be revived.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the third day
          after she had been in the Gabian villa, Celer came out from Rome.
          He was a plain middle-aged man with a bald head, and a short
          brusque manner, but such a man as Domitia felt she could trust.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He informed her
          that Cornelia had been before the Augustus and had entreated him to
          allow his wife to absent herself from the palace, and from his
          company. She had made the plea that Domitia Longina was out of
          health, overstrained by the hurry of exciting events, and that she
          needed complete rest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But I demand more than that,”</span> said she.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam, more than that, my cousin, the Great Mother,
          dared not ask. The prince was in a rough mood, he was highly
          incensed at your having withdrawn without his leave, and he saw
          behind Cornelia’s words the real signification. He behaved to her
          with great ill-humor, and would give no answer one way or the
          other—and that means that here you are to remain, till it is his
          pleasure to recall you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And may that never be,”</span> sighed Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Augustus was incensed against him, because under
          the god Vespasian he had put his servant in the white livery, when
          Flavius Sabinus was elected to serve as consul for the ensuing
          year. Unhappily, the herald in announcing his election gave him the
          title of Emperor in place of consul, through a mere slip of the
          tongue. But it was made an occasion of delation. Messalinus snapped
          at the opportunity, and at once the noble Sabinus was found guilty
          of High Treason, and sentenced to death.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And what has become of Julia, daughter of the god

          "tei tei-q">“She has been brought by the Augustus to the
          Palatine.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day, the
          slave Euphrosyne arrived. She had been sent for by Domitia, and was
          allowed to go to her mistress. She also brought news.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The town was in
          agitation. It was rumored that the Emperor was about to divorce
          Domitia, and to marry his niece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It would be welcome to me were this to take
          place,”</span> said Domitia. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, now,
          Euphrosyne, bring me spindle and distaff, I will be as a spinster
          of old.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So days passed,
          occasionally tidings came from Rome, but these were uncertain
          rumors. Domitia was enjoying absolute peace and freedom from
          annoyance in the country. And she had in Euphrosyne one with whom
          she talked with pleasure, for the girl had much to say that showed
          novelty, springing out of a mind very different in texture from
          that usual among slaves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is a delight to me to be still. Child!—I can well

          toilsome and discouraging life, it is pleasant to fold the hands,
          lay the head on the sod, and go to sleep, without a wish to further
          keep awake.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“But even without that, is life so pleasant that one
          would incline to renew it? Not I for one.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia looked
          up at the fresco of the Quest of Pleasure, and said—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Once I wondered at that picture yonder, and that all
          pleasure attained should resolve itself into a sense of
          disappointment. It is quite true that we pursue the butterfly,
          after we have ceased to value it, but that is because we must
          pursue something, not that we value that which is attained or to be
          attained.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          give me a seat, I must put up my feet. As the Gods love me! what a

          but the people like thee vastly, and the rumor has got about that
          thou wast about to be repudiated, and that raw-boned filly taken in
          your place. First there were murmurings, then pasquinades affixed
          to the statues of the august Domitian. Then bands of rioters passed
          under his windows howling out mocking songs and blasphemies against
          his majesty, and next they clustered in knots, and that Insula of
          Castor and Pollux is a nest of insubordination. In fact, return you
          must to quiet men’s minds. You know what a disturbance in Rome is,
          we have gone through several. By Jupiter! I shall never forget the
          rocking I went through that night of the Lectisternium. These sort
          of things are only unobjectionable when seen from a distance. But
          they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name=

          the delators have a fine time of it, and the rich and noble are

          out a good move, for the people are clamorous for your return. The
          Augustus is but recently proclaimed and allegiance is still
          fresh—and I believe his cousin Ursus has been at him to have you
          back so as to humor the public.”</span></p>

          he will put down this disturbance with a hand of iron. He bears no

          means of the prætorian swords. As to that herd in the block of
          Castor and Pollux, they are reserved for condign punishment, unless
          my dear lady return at once. They will all—men, women and children,
          be driven into the circus. There are a pair of British war
          chariots, with scythes affixed to the axles, and the green drivers
          will be commanded to hustle round the ring at full speed among this
          rebellious rabble, to trample them down, and mow them as barley
          with the scythes—till not one remains alive as a seed of
          disaffection. What I say is—if a thing has to be done, do it
          thoroughly. It is true kindness in the end. Of course some must
          suffer, and one may praise the Gods that in this case it is only
          the common people.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The common people,”</span> gasped Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her eyes were
          glazed with horror. She saw the <span lang="la" class=

          kindly, happy people, so good to one another, so affectionate to
          Glyceria, so grateful to her for visiting among them. And it was
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          who was bringing this punishment upon them. In their blind, foolish
          way, they had misconceived her flight, and in their blind and
          stupid way, had resented an imaginary wrong offered to her, and
          because of their generous championship—they must suffer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On her return to
          Rome and the palace, Domitia did not see the Emperor, but he sent
          her notice to be prepared to appear with him in public at the
          opening of the Circensian Games that he gave to the people in honor
          of his accession to the principate. This was to take place on the
          morrow. The games began at an early hour and lasted all day, with
          an interruption for the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cena</span></span>
          or supper at two o’clock.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Circus was
          close under the Palatine Hill and occupied the valley between it
          and the Aventine. The site has now been taken possession of for
          gas-works.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a long
          structure, with one end like a horseshoe, the other was straight,
          or rather diagonal, a contrivance to enable horses and chariots
          when starting abreast to have equal lengths to run, which would not
          have been the case had the end been drawn straight across the
          circus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This end was
          dignified with two towers, with a central gate between them and
          four arched doors on each side closed with ornamental wooden
          gates.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seats of the
          spectators rose in tiers on all sides, except that of the straight
          side, where above the great entrance was the seat of the director
          of the sports. On one side of the Circus near the winning post was
          the imperial box.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
          263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down the middle
          of the course ran a wall with statues planted on it, but at each
          end was a peculiar structure; that near the winning post sustaining
          seven white balls like eggs, that at the other extremity supporting
          as many bronze dolphins.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each race
          consisted of seven circuits of the course, and a servant of the
          management at each end attended to the number of rounds made, and
          as each concluded, an egg was removed at one end, and a dolphin
          turned round at the other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          separate entrance, with waiting-room for the prince and his party.
          Domitia with her train arrived first, and remained in the
          waiting-room till his arrival.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was dressed
          in blue, with gold woven into the garment, and her hair was tied up
          with blue. She looked very lovely, slender and delicate in color,
          with large earnest indigo eyes, the darkest blue points about her.
          The sadness of her expression could not be dissipated by forced
          smiles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          waiting-chamber she could hear the mutter of voices in the circus;
          all Rome would be there. As she had descended from the Palatine she
          had seen scarce a soul in the forum or the streets, save watchmen
          and beggars.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now pealed the
          trumpets, and next moment the prince, attended by his lictors, and
          with his niece Julia at his side, entered. He scowled at Domitia,
          and beckoned her to approach, then, without another word he went
          out of the door into the Imperial box. Hitherto it had been
          customary for the Empress to sit with the Vestal Virgins. But Nero
          had broken this rule and Domitian, the more to emphasize his
          reconciliation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg
          264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>with Domitia, so as to please the people,
          followed the example of Nero.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia entered
          and moved to the seat on his right; Julia, that on his left. Behind
          them poured a glittering retinue of lictors and soldiers, officers
          of the guard, and officials of the city and chamberlains. At once
          the whole concourse stood, and thundering cheers with clapping of
          hands rose from the circus. The Emperor made a hasty, ungracious
          sign of acknowledgment and took his seat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The applause,
          however, did not die away, it broke out afresh, in spurts of
          enthusiasm, and the name of the Empress was audible—whereupon the
          cheers were prolonged with immense vehemence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian heard
          it. His brow darkened and his face flushed blood-red. He made a
          signal with his hand, at once three priests attended by men bearing
          pick and shovel entered the course, and directed their way to the
          end of the dividing wall or spine; there they threw up the soil,
          till a buried altar was reached, on which at once burning coals
          were placed, and all the concourse rose whilst incense and a
          libation and prayers were offered to the God Consus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That ended, the
          fire was extinguished by the earth being thrown over it. Again the
          altar was buried, and the soil stamped above it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ceremony
          was hardly complete before the great central gates were thrown
          open, to a peal of trumpets, and heralds entered to proclaim the
          opening of the sports given by the Emperor, the Cæsar Domitian, the
          Augustus, son of the God Vespasian, high priest, holder of the
          tribunician power, consul, perpetual Censor, and father of his
          country; sports given for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>pleasure of his well-beloved, the citizens of
          Rome, senators, knights, and people generally, and of such
          strangers as might at the time be in Rome, the centre of the
          world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again rose a
          roar of approbation, men stood up, stamped, jumped on their seats,
          and clapped their hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then through the
          Triumphal Gate came the Circensian procession. This was properly a
          ceremonial of the 13th September; but in honor of the proclamation
          of the accession of Domitian to the throne, and to his giving the
          shows at his own charge, it was now again produced.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First came boys
          on horseback and on foot, gayly clothed, and immediately behind
          them the jockeys and runners who were to take part in the games.
          The racers were divided into four classes, each wearing the color
          of one season of the year. Green stood for spring, red for summer,
          blue for autumn, and white for winter. The riders and drivers were
          dressed according to the class to which they belonged. The chariots
          were drawn by four horses abreast, and each furnished with an
          outrider in the same colors, armed with a whip. At once cries rose
          from all sides, for every jockey and every horse was known by name,
          some cheered the drivers, some shouted the names of the horses,
          some proposed bets and others booked such as they had made.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came
          huntsmen with hounds, armed with lances, and behind them dancing
          soldiers, who clashed shields and swords in rhythm, accompanying
          their dance with choric song.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next entered a
          set of men dressed in sheep’s and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>goats’ skins, and with fluttering ribbons, and
          lastly images of the gods on biers. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“pomp,”</span> though a quaint and pretty sight, was
          looked on with some impatience, as wanting in novelty, and as but a
          prelude to the more exciting races.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
          having made the circuit of the arena, retired, and with great
          rapidity the first four racing chariots were got into their
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">caveæ</span></span>, the vaults on the right
          side of the entrance with four doors opening on to the circus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now a
          chalked line was rapidly stretched across the course in front of
          the gates. A trumpet sounded, the gates were thrown open and the
          four chariots issued forth and were drawn up abreast behind the
          line, and lots cast to determine their positions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitian
          stretching forth his hand, threw a white napkin into the arena, the
          white cord fell, and instantly the chariots started.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spectators
          swayed and quivered, shouted and roared, women waved their veils,
          men clashed potsherds; some yelled out bets, and one or two from
          behind stumbled forward and fell among the occupants of the benches
          in front.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the further
          end, where the circus described a horseshoe, a gallery of wood
          projected over the heads of those on the lower stages, to
          accommodate still more spectators; and these hammering on the
          boards with feet and fists greatly increased the din.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The roar of
          voices rolled like a wave along the right side of the circus, then
          broke into a billow at the curved end, and then surged down to the
          further extremity, again to swell and run and revolve, as an egg
          was dismounted, and a dolphin turned.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At each end of
          the spine, detached from it, were three obelisks, or conical masses
          of stone, sculptured like clipped yew trees. These were the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Metæ</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Attending every
          charioteer was, as already said, an outrider in his colors, to lash
          the horses, and to assist in case of accident. Moreover, boys stood
          about with pitchers of water, to dash over the axles of the wheels
          when they became heated, or to wash away blood stains, should there
          be an accident.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia sat
          watching the race, at first with inattention. Yet the general
          excitement was irresistible, it caught and carried her out of
          herself, and the color mounted into her ivory cheek.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor paid
          no attention to her, he studiously avoided speaking to her, and
          addressed his conversation to Julia alone—who was constrained to be
          present notwithstanding that the execution of her husband had taken
          place but a few days previously. But her heavy face gave no
          indication of acute sorrow. It was due to her position and
          relationship to the prince to be there, and when he commanded her
          attendance, it did not occur to her to show opposition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The keenest
          rivalry existed <a name="corr267" id="corr267" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">between</span> the
          parties of the circus, at a time when political partisanship was
          dangerous except to the sycophants of the regnant prince, all
          faction feeling was concentrated on the colors of the race-course.
          Caligula had championed the green, so had Nero, who had even strewn
          the course with green sand when he himself, in a green suit, had
          driven on it. And now Domitian accepted the green as the color that
          it comported with the dignity of his <span lang="fr" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span> dynasty to favor. It was
          also generally preferred to the other, at any rate in the betting,
          be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name=
          "Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cause it was known
          that the Imperial favorites were allowed to win the majority of the
          races.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the jockeys
          and horses and chariots belonged to different and rival companies,
          and were hired by the givers of games. It was not in the interest
          of the other colors to be beaten too frequently. They therefore
          arranged among themselves how many and which races were, as a
          matter of course, to be won by the green, and the rest of the races
          were open to be fairly contested. But the public generally were not
          let into the secret; though indeed the secret was usually sold to a
          few book-makers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hah! down went
          the red. In turning the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">metæ</span></span>
          at the further end, the wheel had caught in that of the white,
          throwing the latter out, but not upsetting the chariot, whereas the
          car of the red jockey overturned, one horse went down, sprang up
          again, and would have dragged the driver along, had he not
          dextrously whipped a curved knife out of his girdle and cut the
          reins. This was necessary, as the reins of all four horses were
          thrown over the shoulder and wrapped round the body. Consequently a
          fall was certain to be fatal unless the driver had time and
          presence of mind at once to shear through the leathers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is out! the red is out!”</span> roared the mob.
          Then, <span class="tei tei-q">“The white! the white is lagging—he
          cannot catch up!—the red did for him? Out of the way! Out ye two!
          ye cumber the course.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The white
          struggled on, driver and outrider lashed the steeds, they strained
          every muscle, but there was no recovering from the loss of time
          caused by the lock of wheels, and on reaching the doors on the
          right, which were at once swung open, both chariots retreated into
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name=
          "Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">caveæ</span></span>, amidst the groans of such
          as had bets on their favor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It lies now between green and blue!”</span> was the
          general shout. <span class="tei tei-q">“On with the
          Panfaracus!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay! hit the off
          horse, he sulks, Euprepes!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Well
          done, Nereus! Pull well, Auster! Brave horses! brave greens! greens
          for ever! The Gods befriend the greens!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then some one
          looking in the direction of the imperial box noticed Domitia in her
          blue habit, with her blue eyes wide distended, and the blue ribbons
          in her hair. Suddenly in a clear voice he cried,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The blue! the blue! It is the color of the Augusta!
          The blue! Sabaste! I swear by her divinity! I invoke her aid! The
          blue will win.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like an electric
          shock there went a throb through the vast concourse—there were
          nearly three hundred thousand persons present. At once there rose a
          roar, it was loud, thrilling, imperious:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The blue! It shall win! The color of the Augusta! of
          the divine Augusta, the friend of the Roman people! The blue! the
          blue! we will have the blue!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The drivers
          lashed furiously, the outriders swung themselves in their saddles
          to beat the horses. But the gallant steeds needed no scourging,
          they were as keen in their rivalry as were their drivers and their
          supporters.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The last egg! the last dolphin! Again! the green is
          ahead!”</span> a groan broken by only a few cheers. Wonderful! In
          the sudden contagion even those who had betted on the green,
          cheered the rival color.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who was that cried out for the blue?”</span> asked
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name=
          "Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Domitian, turning
          sharply about. <span class="tei tei-q">“Find him, cast him to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His kinsman
          Ursus whispered in his ear,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is the actor Paris. Yet do nothing now. It would be
          inauspicious.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The command was
          grudgingly withdrawn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A
          gasp—stillness, the extreme <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meta</span></span>
          had been turned; then a restless, quivering sound, men, women, too
          agitated to shout, held their breath, but muttered and moved their
          feet—the blue! the blue gains; nay! the green is forging ahead—Ha!
          Ha! at the last moment in swung the blue, across the white line,
          one stride ahead of the green.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then there
          rolled up a thunder of applause.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian turned
          with a look of hate at his wife, and whispered:—</p>

          lady Longina, may it please you to sup with us?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          malevolent glance in his pale watery eye. But Domitia did not see
          it, she looked at him as little as might be.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She rose at
          once. So also did Julia, the daughter of Titus, and the Emperor and
          his train left the circus; but as they withdrew there rose ringing
          cheers, the people standing on their benches and applauding—not the
          Cæsar, the Augustus, the Imperator—but her, Domitia, the blue. The
          people’s own true blue. He heard it, and ground his teeth—his face
          waxed red as blood. Domitia heard it, and her heart filled and her
          eyes brimmed with tears.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitian
          turned and looked at her savagely, as a dog might look at another
          against which it was meditating an onslaught, and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          give expansion to her heart, without misinterpretation, without the
          certainty of incurring outrage?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She withdrew to
          her apartments and changed her dress, from the blue to white with
          purple stripe and fringes. Then she entered the <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span> where the meal was
          spread.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian was
          already there, together with Julia, Messalinus, Ursus, and some
          other friends. The Emperor, standing apart from the latter, said
          with a sneer to Domitia,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“So you have shed your blue—a cloud has passed over the
          azure! That is well. And now, madam, I granted you the first place
          at the games, in the circus, to humor the people; but in my palace
          it shall be as I will, not as they. Julia shall take the
          precedence, and she shall occupy the first position at table, and
          everywhere. She is the daughter of the God Titus, granddaughter of
          the God Vespasian-”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And great grand-daughter of the Commissioner of
          Nuisances.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Silence,”</span> roared Domitian, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“she has the sacred Flavian blood, she is of Divine
          race, and shall sit by me, recline by me, in the position of honor,
          and you occupy a stool at my feet. Julia and I will have a
          lectisternium of the Gods! Am not I divine?—and she
          divine?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Certainly,”</span> answered Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“she is the daughter of a victor who has triumphed, I
          the wife of a man who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
          273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>will filch laurels from his generals, and
          himself has never seen a battle.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian
          clenched his teeth and hands, and glared at her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I wish to the Gods I could find it in my heart to have
          thee strangled, thou demon cat.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I can understand that, having let out the divine blood
          of the Flavii from the throat of your cousin Sabinus, you would
          stoop to me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What—what—what is this?”</span> exclaimed Messalinus,
          thrusting his pointed face in the direction of the prince and
          Domitia; he scented an altercation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for her—she
          wondered at herself, having the courage to defy the Lord of the
          World. She could not keep down the disgust, the hatred she felt for
          the man who had wrecked her life, it must out, and she valued not
          her life sufficiently to deny herself the gratification of throwing
          off her mind the taunts that rose in it, and lodged on her
          tongue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian signed
          to table—Julia, with a flutter of clumsy timidity, shrank from the
          place of honor, and looked hesitatingly at her sister-in-law, who
          without a word seated herself on the stool indicated by the
          Emperor. There was no vulgar pride, no ambition in the daughter of
          Titus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The guests
          looked at each other, as Julia was forced by the command of her
          uncle to recline on the couch properly belonging to his wife, and
          whispered to each other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What, what? Who is where?”</span> asked the
          ferret-faced Messalinus. <span class="tei tei-q">“What has been
          done? Here, Lycus,”</span> to a slave, who always attended him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me, what has been done. In my ear,
          quick, I burn to know.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Something was
          communicated in an undertone, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Messalinus broke into a cackle, that he
          quickly smothered—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That is admirable, great and god-like is our prince!
          As a Jew physician said to me, he sets down one and setteth up
          another, at his pleasure. That is divine caprice. The Gods alone
          can act without having to account for what they do. I like
          it—vastly.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now at once
          the sycophant herd began to pay their addresses to Julia, and to
          neglect Domitia. The former was overloaded with flattery, her every
          word was repeated, passed on from one to another, as though
          oracular. Domitian, conspicuously and purposely ignored his wife
          made to sit at his feet; and raising himself on the left elbow upon
          his <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span class="tei tei-corr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pulvinar</span></span></span>, or cushion of
          gold brocade, talked with his niece, who also reclined instead of
          sitting.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia remained
          silent with lowered eyes, carnations flowered in her cheeks. She
          made no attempt to speak; eat she could not. She felt the slight.
          Her pride was cut to the quick. The humiliation, before such as
          Messalinus was numbing. She would have endured being ordered to
          execution, she would have arranged her hair with alacrity, for the
          bowstring that would have finished her troubles, but this outrage
          before members of the court, before the imperial slaves,—and the
          knowledge that it would be the talk on the morrow of Roman society,
          covered her with confusion, and filled her soul with wrath, for she
          had pride—not a little.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ursus, a kinsman
          of the Emperor, an elderly man, of good character and upright walk,
          was near her. He alone seemed to feel the indignity put upon the
          Empress. His eyes, full of pity, rested on her, and he waited
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name=
          "Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>an opportunity to
          speak to her unheard by others. Then he said, turning his head
          towards Domitia,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady, recall the fable of the oak and the bulrush.
          Humor the prince and you can do with him what you will. Believe me,
          and I speak sincerely,—he loves you still, loves you madly—but you
          repel him and that offends his pride. All things are his, in
          earth,—I may almost say in heaven—and he cannot endure that one
          frail woman’s heart should alone be denied him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There are certain waters,”</span> answered Domitia,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that turn to stone whatever is exposed to
          them—even a bird’s feather. It is as though I had been subjected to
          this treatment. My heart is petrified.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Not so, dear lady, it beats at the present moment with

          "tei tei-q">“Never towards him who has maltreated me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“What—what—what is Ursus saying?”</span> asked
          Messalinus, who caught a word or two. <span class="tei tei-q">“He
          is beside the Augusta—what did he say—and in a low tone also. No
          treason hatching at the table of our Divine Lord, I

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here come the jesters and the mimes,”</span> said
          Ursus, <span class="tei tei-q">“and may the god of Laughter provide
          such matter for mirth as will satisfy Catullus
          Messalinus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then it must be a tragedy,”</span> said another guest,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“for to our blind friend here, naught is
          jocose unless to some other it be painful.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have all our gifts,”</span> said Messalinus,
          smirking.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then entered
          some acrobats who went through <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>evolutions, casting knives and catching them,
          forming human pyramids, ladders, wheels, balancing poles on their
          chins whilst a boy went through contortions at the top.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there was no
          novelty in the exhibition. The Emperor wearied of it, and ordered
          the performers to withdraw.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next appeared
          mimes, who performed low buffoonery in gesture and dialogue,
          interspersed with snatches of song, that were so offensive to
          decency that Domitia, who had never seen and heard anything of the
          kind at her mother’s house, sprang to her feet with flaming cheeks,
          brow and bosom, and made a motion to leave. She knew it—this
          disgusting performance had been commanded by the prince, for the
          purpose of humiliating her. She would go. But Domitian, whose
          malignant glance was on her, saw her purpose and called out,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is my will, Domitia, that you remain in your seat.
          The cream of the entertainment has yet to come.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ursus put his
          hand to her garment and gently drew her down on her seat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Endure it,”</span> he whispered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it will soon be over.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is the worst outrage of all,”</span> said she with
          heaving breast, and the blood so surged into her eyes and ears that
          she could see and hear no more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed, she was
          hardly conscious when the buffoons withdrew, her eyes rested on the
          marble floor, strewn with the remains of the feast.<a id=

          suddenly she started from the dream, or the stupefaction into which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name=
          "Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>she had fallen, by
          hearing the voice of Paris, the tragic actor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked up
          sharply, and saw him, a tall, handsome man, of Greek profile, and
          with curly dark hair. He was clad in a long mantle, and wore the
          buskins. Behind him were minor performers, to take a part in
          dialogue, or to chant a chorus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lord and Augustus, what is it your pleasure that we

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she rose, she

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia returned
          to her apartments, quivering like an aspen in a light air; but no
          sooner was she there, than she summoned Eboracus, and said to
          him:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Be speedy. Follow Paris, and protect him. There is
          evil planned against him. Fly—lest you be too late.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slave
          departed at once.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia paced
          the room, in an agony of mind, now shivering with cold, then with
          face burning. But it was not the humiliations to which she had been
          subjected that so affected her,—it was fear of what she suspected
          was meditated against the actor, and through him against
          Glyceria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cold sweat
          broke out on her brow, and icy tears formed on her long eyelashes.
          It seemed to her that for her to show favor to any one, was to
          bring destruction on that person. And hatred towards the Emperor
          became in her heart more intense and bitter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She could think
          of nothing else but the danger that menaced Paris. She went out on
          the terrace, and the wind blowing over her moist brow chilled her;
          she drew her mantle more closely around her, and re-entered the
          palace. Already night was falling, for the days were becoming
          short.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her heart cried
          out for something to which to cling, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>for some one to whom to appeal against the
          overwhelming evil and tyranny that prevailed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was there no
          power in earth above the Cæsar? There was none. No power in heaven?
          She could not tell; all there was dark and doubtful. There was a
          Nemesis—but slow of step, and only overtaking the evil-doer when
          too late to prevent the misery he wrought, sometimes so lagging as
          not to catch him at all, and so blind as often to strike the
          innocent in place of the guilty. No cry of the sufferer could reach
          this torpid Nemesis and rouse her to quicker action. She was a
          deity bungling, deaf and blind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again she
          tramped up and down the room. She could endure to have no one with
          her. She sent all her servants away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the air
          within was stifling. She could not breathe, the ceiling came down
          on her head, and again she went forth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now she could
          hear voices below in the Sacred Way. She could see lights, coming
          from several quarters, and drawing together to one point where they
          formed a cluster, and from this point rose a wail—the wail of the
          dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She wiped her
          brow. She was sick at heart, and again went within, and found
          Eboracus there, cast down and silent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Speak,”</span> she said hoarsely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It was too late. He had been stabbed in the back,
          whilst leaving the palace, and a pupil was assassinated at the same
          time, because somewhat resembling him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia stood
          cold as marble. She covered her mouth for a moment with her right
          hand, and then in a hard voice said:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Inform Euphrosyne. I cannot.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she turned
          away, went to her bed-chamber, and was seen of none again that
          night. Several of her female slaves sought admission to undress
          her, but were somewhat roughly dismissed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In that long
          night, Domitia felt as one drowning in a dark sea. She stretched
          out her hands to lay hold of something—to stay her up, and found
          nothing. She had nothing to look forward to, no shore to which she
          might attain by swimming, nothing to care for, nothing to cling to.
          There was no light above, only the unsympathetic stars that looked
          down on the evil there was, the wrong that was done, and cared not.
          The pulsation of their light was not quickened by sense of
          injustice, they did not veil their rays so as to hide from them the
          horrors committed on earth. There was no light below, save the
          reflection of the same passionless eyes of heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She felt as
          though she were still capable of the sense of pain, but not of
          being sensible to pleasure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faculty of
          being happy was gone from her forever, and life presented to her a
          prospect of nothing better than gray tracts of monotonous
          existence, seamed with earthquake chasms of suffering.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day she
          rose white and self-restrained, she summoned to her Euphrosyne, but
          did not look at her tear-reddened eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Euphrosyne,”</span> said she, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I bid you go, and take with you Eboracus, I place you
          both wholly at the disposal of your sister—and bid her spare no
          cost, but give to him who has been, a splendid funeral at my
          expense. Here is money. And—”</span> she paused a moment to obtain
          mastery over herself, as her emotion <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>threatened to get the upper hand—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and, Euphrosyne, tell Glyceria that I shall go to see
          her later. Not for a few days, not till the first agony of her
          grief is over; but go I will—for go I must—and I pray the Gods I
          may not be a cause of fresh evil. O, Euphrosyne, does she curse
          me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Glyceria curses none, dear mistress, least of all you.
          Do not doubt, she will welcome you when you do her the honor of a
          visit.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If she were to curse me, I feel as if I should be
          glad—glad, too, if the curse fell heavy on my head—but you know—she
          knows—I meant to do well, to be kind—to—but go your way—I can speak
          no more. Tell Glyceria not to curse me—no—I could not bear that—not
          a curse from her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Euphrosyne saw
          by her mistress’s manner, by her contradictory words, how deeply
          she was moved, how great was her suffering. She stooped, took up
          the hem of her garment, and kissed the purple fringe. Then sobbing,
          withdrew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That day tidings
          came to Domitia to render her pain more acute.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The kindly,
          sympathetic people in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">insula</span></span>
          of Castor and Pollux, in poetic, picturesque fashion had come with
          baskets of violets and late roses, and had strewn with the flowers
          the spot stained with the blood of Paris.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was
          reported to the Emperor, and he sent his guards down the street to
          disperse the people, and in doing this, they employed their swords,
          wounding several and killing two or three, of whom one was a
          child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three days
          later, Domitia ordered her litter and at<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>tendants that she might go to the Insula in
          the Suburra.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had said
          nothing of her intentions, or probably Domitian would have heard of
          them—she was surrounded by spies who reported in his ear whatever
          she did—and he would have forbidden the visit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only when the
          Forum had been crossed, did she instruct the bearers as to the
          object of her excursion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On entering the
          block of lodgings and ascending the stairs Domitia was received
          with respect but with some restraint. The people did not press
          about her with enthusiasm as before; they knew that it was through
          her that evil had overtaken them, and they dreaded her visit as
          inauspicious.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet there was no
          look of resentment in any face, only timorous glances, and
          reverential bows, and salutations with the hand to the lips. The
          poor folk knew full well that it was through no ill-will on her
          part that Paris and his pupil, and some of their own party had
          fallen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was already
          bruited about that Julia daughter of Titus was honored in the
          palace, and advanced above Domitia, the Empress. Some said that
          Domitian would repudiate his wife, that he might marry his niece,
          and that he waited only till the months of mourning for her husband
          were passed, so as not to produce a scandal. Others said that he
          would not repudiate Domitia, but treat her as Nero had treated
          Octavia, trump up false charges against her and then put her to
          death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Already Domitia
          was regarded as unlucky, and on the matter of luck attaching to or
          deserting certain persons, the Roman populace were vastly
          superstitious.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg
          284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now,
          although these poor creatures loved the beautiful woman of imperial
          rank who deigned to come among them, and care for one of their most
          broken and bruised members, yet they feared for themselves, lest
          her presence should again draw disaster upon them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          conscious rather than observant of this as she passed along the
          gallery to the apartment of Glyceria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the door to
          the poor woman’s lodgings she knocked, and in response to a call,
          opened and entered. She waved her attendants to remain without and
          suffer none to enter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she
          approached the bed of the sick woman, hastily, and threw herself on
          her knees beside it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Glyceria,”</span> she said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“can you forgive me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The crippled
          woman took the hands of Domitia and covered them with kisses,
          whilst her tears flowed over them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was more
          than the Empress could bear. She disengaged her hands, threw her
          arms about the widow, and burst into convulsive weeping.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay!”</span> said Glyceria, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“do not give way. It was not thy doing.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But you fear me,”</span> sobbed Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“they do so—they without. Not one touched, not one
          kissed me. They think me of evil omen.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is nothing unlucky. Everything falls out as God

          upon her knees, and took hold of both the poor woman’s hands; so
          that the two, with tear-stained cheeks, looked each other full in
          the face. <span class="tei tei-q">“My Glyceria! wilt thou grant me

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“Oh, Glyceria, I am the most miserable woman on earth.
          I thought I could not be more unhappy than I was—then come—I will
          not speak of it,—thy loss—caused unwillingly by me, because I came
          here—and that has broken my heart. I have done the cruellest hurt
          to the one I loved best. I am most miserable—most
          miserable.”</span> She covered her face, sank on the bed and
          wept.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The widow of the
          player endeavored to soothe her with soft words and caresses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then again
          Domitia spoke. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no one, I have

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I cannot, and I will not.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It has been revealed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Domitia
          threw her arms about the sick woman, she pressed her wet cheek to
          her tear-moistened face, and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come with me, and tell me all thou knowest—and about
          the Fish. Come with me, and give me a little happiness, that I may
          think of thee, comfort thee, read to thee, talk with thee—I care
          for no other woman. And Euphrosyne, thy sister, she is with me, and
          I will keep thee as the apple of mine eye.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, lady! this is too great!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What? anon thou wouldst deny me naught, and now
          refusest me this.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In God’s name so be it,”</span> said Glyceria.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But when?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now. I will have no delay, see—”</span> she went to
          the door and spoke with her slaves. <span class="tei tei-q">“They
          shall bear thee in my litter, at once. Euphrosyne shall tarry here
          and collect thy little trifles, and the good Eboracus, he shall
          bear them to thy new home. O Glyceria! For once I see a
          sunbeam.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never could the
          dwellers in the Insula have dreamt of beholding that which this day
          they saw. The actor’s crippled widow lifted by imperial slaves and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name=
          "Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>placed in the litter
          of the Empress, the Augusta, to whom divine honors had been
          accorded. And, further, they saw the cripple borne away, down the
          lane of the Suburra in which was their block of lodgings, and the
          Empress walked by the side, holding the hand of the patient who lay
          within.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They did not
          shout, they uttered no sound indicative of approval, no applause.
          They held their breaths, they laid their hands on their mouths,
          they looked each other in the eyes—and wondered what this marvel
          might portend. A waft of a new life had entered into the evil
          world, whence it came, they knew not, what it would effect, that
          also they could not conceive—whom it would touch, how transform,
          all was hid from their eyes.</p>

          "font-size: 100%">THE ACCURSED FIELD.</span></span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No notice was
          taken by Domitian of the presence in the palace of the murdered
          actor’s widow. It concerned him in no way, and he allowed the
          unfortunate woman to remain there, under the care of his wife, and
          without making any protest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia found an
          interest and a delight in the society of the paralyzed woman, so
          simple in mind, gentle in thought, always cheerful, ever serene,
          who lived in an atmosphere of love and harbored no resentments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She marvelled at
          what she saw, but it was to her an unattainable condition. Her own
          affections were seared, and a gnawing hate against the man who had
          blighted her life, and to whom she was tied, ever consumed her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was like a
          dead plant in the midst of spring vegetation. It looks down on the
          beautiful life about its feet, but itself puts forth no buds, shows
          no signs of mounting sap.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every now and
          then Glyceria approached the topic of the Fish, and the mysteries
          involved in the symbol, but would not disclose them, for she saw
          that Domitia, however miserable she felt, however hopeless, was not
          in a frame of mind to receive and welcome the interpretation. For
          in her, the one dominating passion was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>hate—a desire to have her wrongs revenged, and
          a chafing at her powerlessness to do anything to revenge them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her treatment by
          Domitian was capricious. At one time he neglected her; then he went
          sometimes out of his way to offer her a slight; at others he made
          real efforts to heal the breach between them, and to show her that
          he loved her still.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he met with
          not merely a frosty but a contemptuous reception, that sent him
          away, his vanity hurt, and his blood in a ferment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In her
          indifference to life, she was able to brave him without fear, and
          he knew that if he ordered her to execution she would hail death as
          a welcome means of escape from association with himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His blundering
          and brutal tyranny was no match for her keen wit cutting into him,
          and maddening him. He revenged himself by a coarse insult or by a
          side blow at her friends. She was without ambition. Many a woman
          would have endured his treatment without repining, for the sake of
          the splendor with which she could surround herself, and the
          towering position which she occupied. But neither had any
          attraction for Domitia. The one thing she did desire, to be left
          alone in retirement, in the country, that he could not, he would
          not accord her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Usually, when he
          was in his splendid villa at Albanum, she elected to remain in
          Rome, and when he came to the palace on the Palatine, if permitted,
          she escaped to Albanum; but he would not always suffer this.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus a wretched
          life was dragged on, and the heart of Domitia became harder every
          day. It would have become as adamant but for the presence of
          Glyceria, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg
          290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>whom the Empress sincerely loved, and who
          exercised a subtle, softening and purifying influence on the
          princess.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria saw how
          the Empress suffered, and she pitied her, saw how hopeless the
          conditions were for improvement; she saw also what was hidden to
          other eyes, that circumstances were closing round and drawing
          towards a crisis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beyond a certain
          point Glyceria could effect nothing, once only did she dare to
          suggest that the Augusta should assume a gentler demeanor towards
          the sovereign of the world, but she was at once cut back with the
          words:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There, Glyceria, I allow no interference. He has
          wronged me past endurance. I can never forgive. I have but one
          hope, I make but one prayer—and that for revenge.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Domitian
          was at Albanum, the Empress enjoyed greater freedom. She was not
          compelled when she went out, to journey in state; and she could
          make excursions into the country as she pleased. The absence of
          gardens on the Palatine and the throng of servants and officers
          made it an almost intolerable residence to her, beautiful as the
          situation was, and splendid as were the edifices on it. Nor was
          this all. Domitian had not rested content with the palaces already
          erected and crowding the summit of the rock,—those of Augustus, of
          Tiberius, and of Caligula, he must build one himself, and to find
          material, he tore down the golden house of Nero.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          construction of his palace served still further to reduce the
          privacy of the Palatine, for it was thronged with masons,
          carpenters and plasterers. In<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>deed the Palatine hill-top was almost as
          crowded and as noisy as was the Forum below.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this, then,
          Domitia was glad to escape to a little villa on the Via Nomentana,
          on a height above the Anio, commanding a view of the Sacred
          Mount.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On one occasion,
          when Domitian was away at Albanum, she had been at this modest
          retreat, where she was surrounded by a few servants, and to which
          she had conveyed Glyceria, to enjoy the pure air and rest of the
          country.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But she was
          obliged to return to Rome; and with a small retinue, and without
          heralds preceding her, she started, and in the morning arrived at
          the Porta Collina. Then Eboracus, coming to the side of the litter,
          said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady, there is a great crowd, and the street is full
          to choking. What is your good pleasure? shall we announce who you
          are, and command a passage?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> answered the princess, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my good Eboracus, let us draw aside, and the swarm
          will pass, then we can go our way unconcerned. I am in no
          precipitate haste, and, in faith, every minute I am outside Rome,
          the better satisfied am I.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But, madam, it is an ill spot, we are opposite the
          Accursed Field.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That matters not. It is but for a brief while. Go
          forward, Eboracus, and inquire what this crowd signifies. Methinks
          the people are marvellously still. I hear no shout, not even a
          murmur.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There be priests leading the way.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is some religious rite. Run forward, Eboracus, and
          make inquiries. That boy bears an inverted torch.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sight was
          extraordinary. A procession of priests <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>was advancing in silence, and an enormous
          crowd followed through the gate, pouring forth like water from a
          sluice, yet without a word spoken. The only sound was that of the
          tramp of feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The place where
          Domitia had halted was just outside the Collina gateway, where was
          the wall of Servius Tullius and in its moat, thirty feet deep, but
          dry, out of which rose the wall of massive blocks to another thirty
          above the level of the ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ditch was a
          pestilential refuse place into which the carcasses of beasts, foul
          rags, sometimes even the bodies of men, and all the unmentionable
          filth of a great city were cast. So foul was the spot, so
          unwholesome the exhalations that no habitations were near it, and
          the wide open space before the wall went by the designation of the
          Accursed Field.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, through
          the gateway came a covered hearse, and at each corner walked a
          youth in mourning garb, one bearing a lamp and oil, another milk in
          a brass vessel, a third water, and a fourth bread. Now, and now
          only, with a shudder of horror, did Domitia suspect what was about
          to take place. She saw how that as the crowd deployed, it thickened
          about one portion of the bank of the ditch, and she saw also the
          battlements above crowded with the faces of men and women leaning
          over to look down into the dyke. And there, at one spot in the
          fosse stood three men. Instinctively Domitia knew who they were—the
          executioner and his assistants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But who was to
          be put to death—and on what charge, and by what means?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the hearse
          was slowly brought to the edge of the moat and the curtains were
          raised.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
          293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia saw
          how that within, prostrate, lay a woman, bound hand and foot to the
          posts by leather straps, with her face covered, and her mouth
          muffled that her cries might not be heard.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She saw the
          attendants of the priests untie the thongs and the unfortunate
          woman was raised to a sitting posture, yet still her face was
          veiled, and her hands were held by servants of the pontiff. Now one
          by one the attendants descended into the moat bearing the lamp and
          the bread and milk, and each handed what he had borne in the
          procession to the executioner, who gave each article as received to
          one of his deputies; and the man immediately disappeared with
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia’s heart
          beat furiously, she put forth her head to look, and discovered a
          hole at the base of the wall, and through this hole she discerned
          the twinkling light of the lamp as it passed within, then it was
          lost. The bread followed, the milk and the water, all conveyed into
          some underground cellar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the
          chief pontiff present plucked the veil from the face of the victim,
          and with a gasp—she could not cry out, the power was taken from
          her—the Empress recognized Cornelia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She made an
          effort to escape from her litter, and fly to her friend with
          outstretched arms, but Eboracus, who with white face had returned,
          caught and restrained her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madam,”</span> he said in a low tone, vibrating with
          emotion, <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray you, for the sake of the
          Gods—do nothing rash. Stay where you are. No power—not that of the
          Sacred Twelve can save her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ye Gods! But what has she done?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She has been accused of breach of her vows, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name=
          "Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>condemned by the
          Augustus, as Chief Priest—”</span> in a lower tone, hardly above a
          whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“unheard in her
          defence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I must go to her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You must not. Nothing can save her. Pray for a speedy
          death.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With glazed
          eyes, with a surging in her ears, and throbbing in the temples—as
          in some paralyzing nightmare—Domitia looked on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the gag
          was removed, and with dignity the Great Mother of the Vestals
          descended from the bier. She stood, tall and with nobility in her
          aspect, and looked round on the crowd, then down into the moat, at
          the black hole under the roots of the wall.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Citizens, by the sacred fire of Vesta, I swear I am
          innocent of the charge laid against me, and for which I am
          sentenced. No witnesses have been called. I have not been suffered
          to offer any defence. I knew not, citizens, until I was told that I
          was sentenced, that any accusation had been trumped up against me.
          Thou, O Eternal God—above all lights in the firmament, Thou, O
          Sovereign Justice that holdest true balances—I invoke Thee—I summon
          the Chief Pontiff who has sentenced me, before your just thrones,
          to answer for what is done unto me this day. I summon him for
          midnight three days hence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the deputy
          of the Chief Pontiff, who presided at the execution, Domitian being
          absent at Albanum (he being Pontifex Maximus), raised his arms to
          heaven in silent prayer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His prayer
          ended, he extended his hand to Cornelia, but she refusing his help,
          unaided descended into the fosse.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vast
          concourse was as though turned to stone by a magician’s wand—so
          immovable was it and so hushed. Some swallows swept screaming along
          the moat, and their shrill cries sent a shudder through the entire
          concourse, wrought to such a tension, that even the note of the
          birds was an intolerable addition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Vestal
          reached the mouth of the pit—the ends of a ladder could be seen at
          the threshold of this opening. It was evident that the opening gave
          access to a vault of some depth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beside it were
          stones from the wall piled up, and mortar. As soon as the Abbess
          reached the opening, she turned, and again declared her innocence.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Emperor,”</span> said she in clear,
          firm tones, <span class="tei tei-q">“has adjudged me guilty,
          knowing that my prayers have obtained for him victory, triumph and
          an immortal name. I repeat my summons. I bid him answer before the
          throne on high, at midnight, three days hence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she looked
          steadily at the blue sky—then up at the sun,—to take a last view of
          light. With calmness, with fortitude, she turned, and entering the
          opening began to disappear, descending the ladder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In so doing her
          veil caught in one of the ends of the side poles of the ladder. She
          must have reascended a step or two, for her hand was visible
          disengaging the white veil, and then—hand and veil disappeared.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately
          stones were caught up, trowels and mortar seized, and with
          incredible celerity the opening was walled up. The pontiff applied
          his leaden seal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Be speedy! Remove her! Run—”</span> shouted Eboracus,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus was
          able to open a way for the litter through the crowd, now clustered
          on the bank of the dyke, watching as the workmen threw down earth
          and stones, and buried deep that portion of the wall in which was
          the vault where the unhappy Abbess Cornelia was buried alive. And
          now the populace broke forth in sighs and tears, and in murmurings
          low expressed at the injustice committed in sentencing a woman
          without allowing her to know that she had been accused, and of
          saying a word in her own defence. Some of the crowd was drifting
          back into Rome, and by entering this current, the train of Domitia
          travelled along.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus
          returned from the head of the litter repeatedly to the side, to
          look within and ascertain whether his mistress were recovering. At
          the first fountain he stopped the convoy and obtained for her water
          to bathe her face, and at a little tavern, he procured strong
          Campanian wine, which he entreated her to sip, so as to nerve
          her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the litter
          approached the Forum, the crowd again coagulated and at last
          remained completely stationary. Again the street was blocked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus went
          forward and forced his way through, that he might ascertain the
          cause, and whether the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>block was temporary and would speedily cease.
          He came back in great agitation, and said hastily to his
          mistress:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady, you cannot proceed. Suffer me to recommend that

          open.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Eboracus—what is going on? tell me.”</span></p>

          lady! I think if you would deign to repose for an hour at your

          started up to embrace the Empress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia received
          the kiss coldly, and sank silent on a stool.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her mother
          looked at her with surprise. Domitia was waxen white, her eyes with
          dark rings about them, and unnaturally large and bright. The color
          had left her lips and these were leaden in hue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia did not
          speak, did not move. She remained for some moments like a

          infantile question? It was your doing, you must understand that.
          You threw yourself on her protection, embraced the altar of Vesta,
          and Cornelia with the assistance of Celer did what she could to
          further your object in leaving Rome. If people will do donkey-like
          things they must get a stick across their backs. It is so, and
          always will be so in this world, and we cannot make it

          say that he is severe in his judgments? Who has hardened him and
          made him cruel?—You—who have dried up all the springs of tenderness
          in his breast. He was not so at first. If he be what men think—it
          is your work. You with your stinging words goaded him to madness
          and as he cannot or will not beat you, as you deserve, he deals the
          blows on some one else. Of course he cuts away such as you regard
          and love—because they obtain that to which he has a right, but
          which you deny him.”</span></p>

          violated hospitality, the most sacred rights that belong to a

          and sleep it off.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia rose,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia went to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man became

          that thou holdest so potent a charm that if thou wilt thou canst
          employ it for his destruction. It is not for me to point out how
          thou mayest twist out of his grasp—thou art a very eel for
          slipperiness, and a serpent for contrivance. What I desire to know
          is—How much longer is this tyranny to last, and how long am I to
          suffer?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
          magician looked round the room, to make sure that he was
          unobserved; he raised the curtain at the door to see that none
          listened outside, and satisfied that he was neither observed nor
          overheard, he pointed to a clepsydra.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was an
          ingenious, but to our minds a clumsy, contrivance for measuring
          time. It consisted of a silver ball, with a covered opening at the
          top, through which the interior could be replenished. About the
          base of the globe were minute perforations through which the liquid
          that was placed in the vessel slowly oozed, and oozing ran together
          into a drop at the bottom which fell at intervals into the bucket
          of a tiny wheel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the bucket
          was full, the wheel revolved and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          bucket to the distilling drops.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At each movement
          of the wheel a connection with it gave motion to the hand of a
          statuette of Saturn, who with his scythe indicated a number on an
          arc of metal. The numbers ranged from one to twelve, and the
          contrivance answered for half the twenty-four hours.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Steps were
          heard, approaching the room, along the mosaic-laid passage, and
          next moment, the curtain was snatched aside, and Domitian, his face

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He clapped his

          you—you my wife whom I have loved, for whom I would have done

          lesson of Tarquin to his son Sextus to nip off the heads of the
          tallest poppies. And the people—you have been currying favor with
          them—against me; the soldiers alone love me, because I have doubled
          their pay; let another offer to treble it and, to a man, they will
          desert me. By the Immortals! it is terrible to be alone—and to be
          plotted against, even by one’s wife.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He walked the
          room, flourishing his tablets, then halted in front of the
          clepsydra.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A long-drawn

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I saw no flash,”</span> said the prince, <span class=

          fall and strike where and whom thou wilt!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He went again to
          the window and looked forth. The air was still and close. The sky
          was enveloped in vapor and not a star could be seen. A continuous
          quiver of electric light ran along the horizon. Then the heavens
          seemed to be rent asunder and a blaze of lightning shot forth,
          blinding to the eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitian turned
          away, and laid the tablets on the marble sideboard as he pressed
          his hands to his eyeballs.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“here comes the rain; it descends in
          cataracts; it falls with a roar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He paced the
          room, halted, stood in front of the clepsydra and looked at the
          dropping water. The water had been reddened, and it seemed like
          blood sweated out of the silver globe. At that moment the wheel
          revolved, and sent a crimson gush into the receiver. With a jerk
          Saturn raised his scythe and indicated the hour ten.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
          turned away, and came in front of Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“None have ever loved me,”</span> he said bitterly,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“how then can it be expected that I shall
          love any? my father disliked me, my brother distrusted me—and
          you—my wife, have ever hated me. I need not ask the cause of that.
          It is Lamia, always Lamia. Because he has never married you think
          he still harbors love for you; and you—you hate me because of him.
          It is hard to be a prince, and to be alone. If I hear a play—I
          think I catch allusions to me; if it be a comedy—there is a jest
          aimed at me; if a tragedy, it expresses what men wish may befall
          me. If I read a historian, he declaims on the glories of a
          commonwealth before these men, these Cæsars became tyrants, and as
          for your philosophers—away with them, they are wind-bags, but the
          wind is poisonous, it is malarious to me. When I am at the circus,
          because I back green—you, the entire hoop of spectators cheer, bet
          on the blue—to show me that they hate me. At the Amphitheatre, if I
          favor the big shields, then every one else is for the small
          targets. A prince is ever the most solitary of men. If you had
          protested that you loved me, had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>fondled me, I would have held you in
          suspicion, mistrusted your every word and look and gesture. Perhaps
          it is because that you have never given me good word, gentle look,
          and gesture of respect that I feel you are true—cruelly true, and I
          have loved you as the only true person I know. Now answer me—you
          asked after my death?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> answered Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia signed

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some moments
          Domitia remained without stirring. But then, roused by a glare of
          lightning, succeeded by a crash so loud as to shake the palace, she
          saw in the white blaze the tablets of the Emperor lying on the
          table.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At once, aware
          of the importance of what she had secured, she seized them, and
          went to the lamp to open them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They consisted
          of thin citron-wood boards, framed and hinged on one side, the
          surfaces within covered with a film of wax, on which notes were
          inscribed with a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          pen. There were stray leaves that served for correspondence, orders
          and so forth, but what Domitia now held was a diptych, that is to
          say, two leaves hinged, like a book-cover, which had included loose
          sheets and were bound together by strings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She at once
          opened the diptych, and saw on the first page:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The words
          applying to Lamia acted on her as a blow against her heart. She
          staggered to a stool, sank on it and struggled for breath.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the urgency
          of the danger allowed no delay—she rallied her strength

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To him,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She sank again
          on the stool and put her hands to her temples and pressed them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lightning
          continued to flare and the thunder to roll. There ensued a turmoil,
          and a sound of voices crying; then a rush of feet. Euphrosyne
          entered with startled mien—<span class="tei tei-q">“My mistress!

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarce had she
          spoken, before quick steps were heard, and in a moment Domitian
          entered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parthenius
          hastily concealed the tablets by throwing a fold of his garment
          over the hand that held them. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sire,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
          come to announce that thy chamber must be on this side.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Go thy way,”</span> said Domitian roughly,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“see to it that I have a bed brought at
          once. Hast heard, Domitia, the fire has fallen!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sire,”</span> said Parthenius, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I haste to obey and pray the Gods that in spite of
          thunder and lightning you may sleep sound and not
          wake.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg
          314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
          walked to the clepsydra, and laughed scornfully. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The bolt of Jove has missed me,”</span> said he.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The red-handed One made a mistake. I am
          wont to be in bed at this hour—by good luck, this night I was not.
          He has levelled his bolt at my pillow and burnt that—I am escaped
          scot-free. Now I have no further fear.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The temple of your divine family is in
          flames.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What care I? I will rebuild it—the majesty, the
          divinity of the Flavians resides not in stones and marble—it is
          incorporate in Me. I may have been in danger for a moment. Now I
          snap my fingers in the face of that blunderer Jove, who burnt a
          hole in my pillow instead of transfixing my head. And yon old
          Chronos—”</span> he made a sign of contempt towards scythed Time,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I defy thee and thy bucket of blood.
          Twelve o’clock! In spite of Jove’s bolt, and the summons of
          Cornelia—I shall be asleep by that hour.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I pray the Gods it may be so.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitian
          went out precipitately. His defiant attitude, his daring talk did
          not serve to disguise the alarm which he felt. Suddenly, after
          having left the room he turned, came back and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia! What sword is that? What need has a woman
          with a sword?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He pointed to
          that of Corbulo, suspended against the wall.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He went to it
          and took it down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Leave it,”</span> said she harshly. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is that on which my father fell. It is stained
          likewise with the blood of Nero.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He held it by
          the scabbard. She caught the handle and, as he turned, drew forth
          the blade.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          moment he heard steps in the passage <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>approaching the door, and without noticing
          that he held but the sheath, or else purposing to demand the weapon
          itself later, when the interruption was over, he walked towards the
          entrance uttering an expression of impatience, holding the empty
          scabbard in his right hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the doorway
          stood Stephanus, a freedman, the steward of Flavia Domitilla, wife,
          or rather widow of Clemens, whom Domitian had recently put to
          death. Domitilla had been exiled, and the Emperor had appropriated
          to his own use the estates of his kinsman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why camest thou hither?”</span> asked the prince
          roughly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall have enough to say to
          thee on the morrow because of thy embezzlements.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Augustus! I am innocent.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A thief, a vile purloiner, a blood-sucking leech, that
          has fattened as do all thy kind on thy masters. Go thy way—I want
          thee not here.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And striding
          towards him, with Corbulo’s scabbard he struck the freedman across
          the face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanus
          uttered a cry of rage and pain, and instantly smote at the Emperor
          with a dagger he had held concealed in his sleeve.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What, hound! You dare! You shall be flayed alive! Ho!
          to my aid!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanus threw
          himself on the Emperor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          stepped between the struggling men and the doorway, and with one
          hand drew together the curtains so as to muffle the cries.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To my aid! to my aid!”</span> called Domitian, as the
          powerful steward grappled him, and struck his dagger into the thigh
          of the prince.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To my aid! Ho, a sword!”</span> shouted the Emperor,
          and he grasped the weapon of the steward but <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so that, holding the blade with his
          hand, the weapon cut it across and the blood streamed forth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He now made an
          effort to reach the doorway; and the steward, holding him, strove
          to wrench away the dagger and inflict a mortal wound. But Domitian,
          aware of his object, with his bleeding hand retained his grasp of
          the blade.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All at once, the
          Emperor let go his hold, and seizing the steward by the head drove
          his thumbs into his eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanus
          instantly dropped the dagger in his attempt to save himself from
          being blinded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two men
          twisted and writhed in grapple with each other. The freedman was a
          powerful man—it was for this reason he had been sent to despatch
          the prince. But Domitian was battling for his life. Though his legs
          were thin and out of proportion to his body, he was a strong man—he
          had ever maintained his vigor by exercise of the muscles and had
          never weakened himself by excess in eating and drinking.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By a happy turn
          he flung Stephanus, but clasped by him fell with him on the
          floor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the two
          men rolled and tossed in a tangled mass together. Their snorts and
          gasps and the bestial growl of rage filled the room.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Quick! Domitia—the sword! At once—the sword—the
          sword!”</span> said the Emperor. He spoke in gulps and gasps.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had Stephanus
          under him; his knee was on his chest and his hand, the gashed left
          hand flowing with blood, contracted the prostrate man’s throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia! the sword!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But she stood,
          stern, cold, without stirring a step, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and she folded the sword of her father to her
          breast, with her arms crossed over it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“Because of Lucius Lamia—No!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She went to the
          curtains, drew them apart, and called down the passage to
          Norbanus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two
          Prætorian præfects were there with the chamberlains—but they were
          ill able to restrain the guard who suspected that their prince and
          Emperor was in danger and scented treachery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly a rush
          was made. Some of the soldiers, with the præfect Norbanus, came on
          running, whilst the other, Petronius Secundus, endeavored by his
          authority to restrain the rest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But from the
          other end of the passage came gladiators running, hastily brought
          together by Parthenius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment
          there was a jam in the doorway, a burly gladiator and a soldier of
          the guard were wedged together, each endeavoring to hold the other
          back and force himself in.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile
          Petronius continued to exhort his soldiers to stand back, and
          Parthenius to promise rewards to the gladiators who pressed on. The
          tumult became terrible. Men came to blows without, there was a
          running together of slaves and freedmen—of frightened women and
          pages from all sides. Some had leaped from their beds, roused from
          sleep, and were not clothed. Some bore lamps—but again certain
          others attempted to extinguish the lights. Some cried <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Treason!”</span> Others <span class="tei tei-q">“Away
          with the monster!”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
          318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Some called out <span class="tei tei-q">“Nerva
          is the <span class="tei tei-corr">Emperor!</span>”</span> others
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Domitian is the Augustus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
          gladiator at the door, by dint of elbowing, forced his way within,
          but he was unarmed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next moment the
          Prætorian guardsman held back by the gladiator entered and struck
          at Stephanus, dealing a frightful blow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Relieved by this
          assistance, Domitian staggered to his feet and glared about him. He
          was too much out of breath to speak, and in at the door came others
          pressing, some crying one thing, some another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          unfolded her arms, and taking the sword of Corbulo in her right
          hand, extended it to the gladiator and said—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Make an end.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man snatched
          at the haft; and with a blow drove the blade into the breast of the
          Emperor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still the prince
          remained standing, and stretched forth his hands gropingly for a
          weapon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parmenas leaped
          at him, and with a knife struck him in the throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he reeled;
          in another moment he was surrounded, blows from all sides were
          rained on him. Again the sword of Corbulo was lifted and again
          smote, and he fell as a heap on the body of Stephanus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment
          there was stillness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then in that
          hush sounded a click and a gush. The bucket of the clepsydra had
          discharged, and with a jerk Saturn raised his scythe and pointed to
          the hour of midnight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He has answered his summons before the seat of Divine

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She stooped and
          plucked the signet ring from the finger of the murdered prince.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner had
          Domitia got the signet from the finger of the dead Emperor, than
          she hastened from the room, trembling, almost blind as to her
          course, but armed with more than her natural strength to force her
          way through those who filled the passage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parmenas was now
          there, and he cleared a way for her, and in a loud voice forbade
          any of the slaves to leave the palace; Petronius at the same time
          gave orders to the soldiers of the guard to remain where they were,
          keeping watch that none left to spread the tidings, until Cocceius
          Nerva had been communicated with, and the Senate had been
          summoned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia,
          however, made her way from among the excited and alarmed throng,
          and finding some of her own slaves, bade them bring Eboracus to
          her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am here, lady,”</span> answered the Briton.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stared at her
          in amazement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He snatched a
          torch from an attendant, and advanced towards a postern gate that
          communicated with a flight of steps leading to the Forum. It was
          employed almost <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg
          320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>wholly by the servants and was used for
          communication between the kitchen and the markets.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shall we take any one else with us?”</span> asked
          Eboracus. He answered himself—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—here is
          Euphrosyne. She shall attend, and a boy shall carry the link. At
          night—and on such a night, I must have both arms at my
          disposal.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia said
          nothing. She was eager to be on her way, was impatient of the
          smallest delay. Euphrosyne came up, and obeyed a sign from the
          Briton. He caught a scullion who was rubbing his sleepy eyes, and
          wondering what had caused the commotion, and had roused him from
          his bed. Eboracus thrust the torch into his hand and opened the
          door for the Empress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia stepped
          out to the head of the stairs. The rain had ceased, but the steps
          were running with water. The eaves dripped. The shrubs were laden
          with rain, they stooped their boughs and shed a load of moisture on
          the soil, then raised their leaves again, once more to accumulate
          the wet, and again to stoop and shower it down. Runnels conveying
          water from the roof were flowing as streams, noisily: the ground
          covered with pools, reflected the torch; as also every gleam from
          the retiring storm. Still in the distance thunder muttered, but it
          was a grumble of discontent at having failed to achieve all it had
          been sent to execute.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On such a night
          few would be abroad, except the patrols of the <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Vigiles</span></span> and them there would be
          no difficulty in passing as the watchword was known to Eboracus,
          the word which allowed those only who could say it to traverse the
          streets at night in the respectable portions of the city. But there
          were no lamps, not even the feeble glimmer of a lantern slung in
          the midst of the street. Notwithstanding all the civili<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>zation of ancient Rome the art of
          lighting the thoroughfares at night was unknown. Such as were
          constrained to walk abroad after dark were attended by slaves
          bearing torches.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The streets of
          Rome had for long been of bad repute for the brawls and murders
          committed in them at night. Tipsy youths and rufflers had assaulted
          honest men, and should a woman be out after dark, she was certain
          of insult. Nero himself had distinguished himself in such vulgar
          performances. But under the Flavian princes much had been done to
          establish order and to ensure protection to life and purse of such
          as were out after dark, so that now, except in the slums, a citizen
          could visit his friends, a doctor his patients, by night, without
          fear of molestation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And of all
          portions of Rome, the Forum with its splendid monuments, its rich
          temples, especially that of Saturn, that contained the city
          treasures, was most patrolled and therefore the safest. Eboracus
          had little expectation that his mistress would meet with rudeness
          or encounter danger, the rain must have swept the street of all
          idlers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The long flight
          of steps was descended with caution, as they were slippery with
          rain, indeed with more caution than Domitia approved, so impatient
          was she to reach the object of her journey. The distance was not
          great. She had but to traverse the upper end of the Forum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That at which
          she aimed was the prison of Rome. It lay at the foot of the
          Capitoline Hill, and consisted of an ancient well or subterranean
          chamber in which flowed a small spring. Above this was the prison,
          consisting of a series of cells that rose in stages to a
          considerable height, against the rock, the chambers being in part
          scooped out of the travestine. From the top <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the hill ran a set of steps called
          the Gemonian stair, and it was customary for State prisoners who
          had been condemned to death, after execution to be cast from the
          upper chamber of the Tullianum down the stairs; whence with hooks
          the corpses were dragged across the Forum and then flung into the
          Tiber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the house of
          the jailer, Domitia with her attendants made her way. She had been
          stopped once in crossing the Forum, but the watch recognized her,
          and saluted with respect, though with an expression of astonishment
          on his countenance at seeing Cæsar’s wife abroad at such a time of
          the night, in such weather and with such scant attendance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching the
          jailer’s door, Eboracus knocked. No answer was given. He knocked
          again and louder, and continued knocking, till at length a gruff
          voice from within called to know who was without, and what was
          wanted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Open—in the name of the Augustus,”</span> said the
          British slave; and at once the keeper of the prison let down the
          bars and withdrew the bolts and chains, then carrying a lamp,
          peered out at those who demanded admittance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          stood forward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You have a prisoner here—Lucius Ælius
          Lamia?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You must lead me to him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">The</span> jailer appeared disconcerted, he held his
          lamp aloft and eyed the woman who spake. He did not know her, his
          light was feeble, and as it happened, he had seen little of the
          Empress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You do not know me,”</span> said Domitia. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Know you this ring?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          prison-keeper held the flame of his lamp to the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>signet, and made the usual sign of
          respect and recognition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You are required to lead me within,”</span> said
          Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The jailer at
          once stood aside, and suffered the Empress and her attendants to
          enter. Then he barred and bolted the door again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> said Domitia, impatient at the
          leisurely proceeding of the man, <span class="tei tei-q">“lead me
          to him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without another
          word he went forward, holding his lamp down that those who followed
          might see the steps and not stumble at them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This way,”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and bow your heads, the entrance is low; but most of
          them that pass this way have to hold their heads still lower when
          they are taken out. Look at these stones—great blocks built by the
          Kings—by Servius Tullus, they say. By Hercules! this is not a
          tavern where men tarry long, nor do they relish our fare. One thing
          I must say in our favor, we make no charge for our
          hospitality.”</span> Thus the jailer muttered as he went along.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Look there—on your right—there is the cell where Simon
          Bar Gioras, the Jew, was strangled—he who was the last to maintain
          the struggle against the God Titus, in defence of Jerusalem; and
          see—”</span> he threw open a door. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is
          the Bath of Mamertius in which Jugurtha was starved, all in
          blackness of darkness and soaking in ice-cold water. What!
          Impatient—do you not care to see the sights and hear my gossip?
          Well, well—but I have pretty things to show. I have a shankbone of
          Appius Claudius, who committed suicide in yon cell, and a garment
          of Sejanus, and the very bowstring wherewith—I am going on as fast
          as may be. See! we have had Christians here also. There was another
          Jew, Simon Petrus by name, he was in this <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>cell, and I have the chain whereby he was
          bound, and I sell the links to the followers of the
          Nazarene,”</span> he began to cackle. <span class="tei tei-q">“By
          Hercules! the chain is long enough. They come for more links than
          there would be, were the chain to reach across the Tiber. But any
          bit of old iron will serve, and they are not particular—take any
          scrap and pay in silver. I am going as fast as may be. I am not
          young. Fast enough I warrant. He is in no hurry—not Lamia. He can
          wait. All the same to him whether we reach him now or an hour
          hence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia,
          whose brow was beaded with cold sweat, like the stones of the vault
          that ran with moisture, laid hold of the prison-keeper’s arm and
          said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me—is he—”</span> she could not
          say the word, her heart beat so furiously, and everything swam
          before her eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Aye, aye, you shall see for yourself. Come from the
          Augustus to satisfy him that we do our work properly, I trow. I
          have not much strength in these old-hands, but my two sons are
          lusty—and say the word—they will bend your back and snap the spine,
          smite and shear off your head like a pumpkin under a scythe, twist,
          and the life is throttled out of you. Here—here we are. Go in and
          see for yourself that we are good workmen.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He threw open a
          door and raised his lamp.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A low vaulted
          chamber was faintly illumined by the flame, the torch held by
          Eboracus was behind Domitia and the jailer; he had taken it from
          the link boy at the prison door. He and Euphrosyne attended their
          mistress, the boy was left without.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old
          prison-keeper stood on one side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The order came yesterday,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and we are not slack in the
          execution.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia saw the
          figure of a man lying on the stone floor. She started
          forward—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I warrant you—right soundly.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She uttered a
          smothered cry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Put down the lamp!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She turned and
          faced the jailer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Leave me alone with him.
          I will wake him. I know he but sleeps.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man
          hesitated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Eboracus
          pressed forward and laid hold of the jailer and
          whispered—<span class="tei tei-q">“Go without, it is the
          Augusta!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The keeper of
          the prison started, raised his hand to his lips, bowed, set the
          lamp on the moist floor and drew back.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Without! Without all!”</span> ordered Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Eboracus
          pulled the jailer out of the cell. Euphrosyne stood doubtful
          whether to remain with her mistress or obey—but an impatient sign
          from the Empress drove her forth, and the British slave closed the
          door.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is dead,”</span> said the jailer. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Did the Augustus desire to withdraw the order? His
          signet has arrived too late. The prisoner has been throttled by my
          sons.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man and
          the two slaves remained for some quarter of an hour in the passage
          almost smothered by the smoke emitted by the torch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From within they
          heard a voice—at intervals, now raised in weeping, then uttering
          low soothing tones, then raised in a cry as the <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conclamatio</span></span> of hired wailers for
          the dead, calling on Lamia by name to return, to return, to leave
          the Shadowland and come back into light.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And then—a
          laugh.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A laugh so
          weird, so horrible, so unexpected, that with a thrust, without
          scruple, Eboracus threw open the door.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the stone
          pavement sat Domitia, her hair dishevelled, and on her lap the head
          of the dead man. She was wiping his brow with her veil, stooping,
          kissing his lips, weeping, then laughing again—then pointing to
          purple letters, crossed L’s woven into his tunic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eboracus saw it

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the old home
          of Gabii, under the tender care of Euphrosyne and in the soothing
          company of Glyceria, little by little, stage by stage, Domitia
          recovered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          horrible past to which no reference might be made. The true British
          slave, Eboracus, was ever at hand to help—when needed. Never a day,
          never half a day, but his honest face appeared at the door to
          inquire after his dear lady, and as her senses came flickering
          back, it was he to whom she clung to take her in his arms into the
          trellised walk, or when stronger to lead her where she could pick
          violets for Glyceria, and to pile about the feet of the little
          statue of the Good Shepherd. He took her a row on the lake and let
          her fish—he found nests of young birds and brought them to her; and
          all at once disclosed great powers of story-telling; he told
          marvellous British tales as to a little child, of the ploughing of
          Hu Cadarn, of Ceridwen and her cauldron. And he would sing—he
          fashioned himself a harp, of British shape, and sang as he
          accompanied himself, but his ballads were all in the Celtic tongue
          that Domitia could not understand—<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>nevertheless it soothed and pleased her to
          listen to his music.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Longa Duilia did
          not visit her often. She made formal duty calls at long intervals,
          and as Domitia became better, these visits grew proportionately
          fewer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Duilia, as she
          herself said, was not created to be a nurse. She knew that some
          were fitted by nature to attend to the sick, and all that sort of
          thing—but it was not her gift. Society was her sphere in which she
          floated and which she adorned, but she was distraught and drooping
          in a sick-room. She wished she had the faculty—and all that sort of
          thing—but all women were not cast in the same mould, run out of the
          same metal—and, my dear, parenthetically—some are of lead, others
          of Corinthian brass—and which are which it is not for me to say—she
          thanked the Gods it was so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor did the
          visits and efforts to amuse, of Duilia, avail anything towards
          Domitia’s cure. On the contrary, she was always worse after her
          mother had been with her. The old lady ripped up ill-healed sores,
          harped on old associations, could not check her tongue from
          scolding.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My poor dear child—I never made a greater blunder in
          my life—I, too, who have the pedigree at my finger’s ends—as to
          fancy that there was any connection with those Flavians. My dear!
          yellow hair is quite out of fashion now, quite out. Look at mine, a
          raven’s wing is not darker. It was through Vespasia Polla—I thought
          we were related—stupid that I was—it was the Vipsanians we were
          allied to, not those low and beggarly Vespasians. As the Gods love
          me, I believe Polla’s father was an army contractor. But I have
          made it all right. I have smudged out the line I had <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>added to the family tree, and as for the
          wax heads of those Flavians, I have had them melted up. Will you
          believe it—I had the mask of Domitian run into a pot and that
          stupid Lucilla did not put a cover on it, and the rats have eaten
          it—eaten all the wax. I hope it has clogged their stomachs and
          given them indigestion. They doubtless thought it was dripping. But
          I really have made a most surprising discovery. I find there was an
          alliance with the Cocceii—most respectable family, very ancient,
          admirable men all—and so there is a sort of cousinship with the
          present admirable prince. His brother Aulus—rather old perhaps—but
          an estimable man—is—well—may be—in a word, I intend to give a
          little supper—a dainty affair—all in the best style—so sorry you
          can’t be there, my dear Domitia—but of course absolutely
          impossible. Your state of health and all that sort of thing. Don’t
          be surprised if you hear—but there, there—he is rather old though,
          for one who is only just turning off the very bloom of life and
          beauty.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After such a
          visit and such talk the mind of Domitia was troubled for several
          days. She became timid, alarmed at the least noise, and distraught.
          But then the poor crippled woman succeeded in comforting and laying
          her troubles, and the painful expression faded from her face. It
          became placid, but always with a sadness that was inseparable from
          the eyes, and a tremulousness of the lips, as though a very
          little—a rough word or two—would dissolve her into tears.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the spring,
          the growing light, the increasing warmth, the bursting life in
          plant and insect, she began to amend more steadily, and relapses
          became fewer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One sweet spring
          day, when Glyceria had been car<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the turf near her with purple anemones in her lap, that she was
          binding into a garland, the paralyzed woman was startled by hearing
          Domitia suddenly speak of the past.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She spoke, and
          continued weaving the flowers, <span class="tei tei-q">“My
          Glyceria, I intend this for the little temple of my father. It is
          all I can do for him—to give flowers where his ashes lie—but it
          does not content me. There were two whom I loved and looked up to
          as the best of men, and both are gone—gone to dust: my own dearest
          father, and my lover, my husband, Lamia. I cannot bear to think of
          them as heaps of ashes or as wandering ghosts. When that thought
          comes over me, I seem to be as one drowning, and then darkness is
          before my eyes. I cannot cry—I smother.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know that they are dust—I suppose they are shadows.
          But of anything else, all is guess-work, we know nothing—and that
          is so horrible. I love two only—have loved two only—and they are no
          more than shadows. No, no! I mean not that.”</span> She flung her
          arms about Glyceria, and laid her cheek against that of the sick
          woman. <span class="tei tei-q">“No, I do love you, and I love
          Euphrosyne and I love Eboracus. But I mean—I mean in a different
          manner. One was my father, and the other my husband. It is so
          terribly sad to think they are lost to me like yesterday or last
          summer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes—I know it will be so.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Glyceria
          took the hand of Domitia, and looking into her eyes, said solemnly:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost thou remember having asked me about
          the Fish?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes—this amulet,”</span> answered the noble lady, and
          she detached the cornelian from her throat, and held it in the hand
          not engaged by Glyceria. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—I
          recollect—there was some mystery, but what was it?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Fish is a symbol, as I said once before, and it is

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of what is it the symbol?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of One who died—who tasted of the bitterness of the

          the virtue of His resurrection gives power to all who believe in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia looked
          at the little cornelian fish; she could not

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Domitia
          burst into tears.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria stroked
          her hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There—you see how joyous is our hope. Death is

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O, Glyceria! O, if I could see them—O Glyceria! O, you
          should not have said this if it be not true. My heart will break.
          O, if it might be so! if I could! but once only—for a
          moment——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, that would not suffice; forever, never to be

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day
          Glyceria saw by the red eyes of Domitia that she had slept little
          and had wept much. She did not turn the conversation to the same
          topic; she wisely waited for the noble lady to begin on it herself,
          and she judged that she would take some time to consider what had
          been spoken about and to digest it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And in fact
          Domitia made no further allusion to the matter for some days. But
          after about a week, when alone with the paralyzed woman, she said
          to her abruptly: <span class="tei tei-q">“You have never been in
          Syria?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, dear lady.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have—and I have been on the confines of the desert
          and looked away, as far as the eye could reach, and have seen
          nothing but sand and barren rock. Behind me a rose-garden,
          syringas, myrtle and citron trees, and murmuring streams, before
          me—no green leaf, only death. It is to me, as I stand now and look
          back on my life as if it were that barren desert; and the fearful
          thing is—I dare not turn and look the other way, for it is into
          impenetrable night. But no, my life is not all desolation, there
          are just two green spots in it where the date palms stand and there
          are wells—my childhood, when I sat on my father’s knee and cuddled
          into his arms; and once again, when I was recovering from the loss
          of him and was basking in the joy of my love for Lucius Lamia. All
          the rest—”</span> she made a gesture of despair—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Death.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dearest lady! I would like to turn you about and show
          you that where you think only blackness reigns, lies a beautiful
          garden, a paradise, and One at the gate who beckons and says, Come
          unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah! but that may be all fancy and dream work like the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria got no
          further than this. Domitia was disposed to talk with her on her
          hope, and on the Christian belief, but always with reserve and some
          mistrust.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were old
          prejudices to be overcome, there was the consciousness that the
          promises so largely made <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
          333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by
          the votaries of the many cults from East and South who came to Rome
          were unfulfilled, and this made her unable to place confidence in
          the new religion held by slaves and ignorant people, however
          alluring it might seem.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the very
          few who came to Gabii during her illness and convalescence, was
          Flavia Domitilla, the widow of Flavius Clemens, who had been put to
          death by Domitian. Domitilla had been banished, but returned
          immediately on the death of the tyrant. She had suffered as had
          Domitia. In her manner and address there was something so gentle
          and assuring, that the poor ex-empress, in the troubled condition
          of her brain, was drawn to her, and after her visits felt better.
          She knew, or rather supposed, that Domitilla was a Christian. Her
          husband had been one, and had suffered for his faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was with real
          pleasure that she ran to welcome her one morning, when the steward
          entered and announced: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lady Flavia

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Magpies bring sorrow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, two—mirth—we have cast our sorrows behind us. You
          said I was a dove, so be it—a pair of doves, perhaps wounded,
          lamed—but we coo into each other’s ear, and lay our aching hearts
          together and so obtain solace.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will refuse you nothing,”</span> said Domitia, again
          kissing her visitor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, a
          couple of hours later the two ladies started, Domitia taking with
          her some attendants, but travelling, as was proposed, in the large
          litter of Domitilla.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This latter lady
          was, as already mentioned, the widow of Clemens, one of the two
          sons of Flavius Sabinus, præfect of the city, who had held the
          Capitol against the Prætorians of Vitellius and had been murdered
          but a few hours before Rome was entered by the troops that favored
          his brother Vespasian. On that occasion his sons had escaped, and
          the elder was married to Julia, daughter of Titus, but had been put
          to death by Domitian. The younger brother, Clemens, a quiet,
          inoffensive man, who took no part in public affairs, had been
          executed as well, shortly before Domitian himself
          perished.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Flavia
          Domitilla lived quietly on her estate not far from the Ardeatine
          Gate of Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How!”</span> said Flavia, suddenly, as she espied the
          little cornelian suspended on the bosom of Domitia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you have the Fish!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, Glyceria gave it me—long ago.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Do you know what it means?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Glyceria told me—but it is a dream, a beautiful fancy,
          nothing more. There is no evidence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia, you have not sought for it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My cousin, Rome is full of religions. Some say the
          truth is in Sabazius, some in Isis, some in the stars, some in
          Mithras—a new importation—and some will go back to the old Gods of
          our Latin ancestors. But one and another all are
          naught.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How know you that?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the spirit that is within me. It can discern
          between what is true and false. Not that which promises best is the
          most real.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You are right, Domitia—that is truest and most real
          which meets and satisfies the seeking, aching heart.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And where is that?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where you have not sought for it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If I were sure I would seek. But I am weary of
          disillusionings and disappointments.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well—will you hear?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am not sure. I have met with too many
          disappointments to desire another.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing further
          was said on this topic till the villa was reached. Domitia showed
          that she did not desire to have it pursued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Flavia
          alighted from her litter, a young man <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>approached, handed her something and asked for
          an answer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The widow of
          Clemens opened a tied diptych and read some words written
          therein.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She seemed
          disconcerted and doubtful. She looked questioningly at Domitia, and
          then asked leave of the latter to say a word in private to
          Euphrosyne. Leave was granted and a whispered communication passed
          between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Flavia
          looked inquiringly at Domitia, and it was with considerable
          hesitation that she signed to the young man to approach, and
          said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Be it so. The Collect shall be
          here.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That evening
          before she and her guest parted for the night, Flavia took Domitia
          by the hand and said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“You are right—the
          faculty of determination is seated in every breast. Inquire and
          choose.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days
          passed, and then the hostess became uneasy. Evidently she had
          something that she desired to say, but was afraid of broaching the
          subject.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length,
          abruptly, she began on it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Domitia, I show you the utmost confidence. I must tell
          you something. You know how that the Christians have been
          persecuted under—I mean of late, and how we have suffered. My dear
          husband shed his blood for the cause, and he was but one among
          many. Now there is a respite granted, but how long it will last we
          know not. The laws against us stand unrepealed and any one who
          wishes us ill can set them in motion for our
          destruction.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You do not think, Cousin——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, hear me out, Domitia. You saw a young man
          approach me as we arrived here. He is what we <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>term a deacon, and he came to announce
          that, if I saw fit, the Church would assemble in my house next
          first day of the week, that is the day after the Jewish Sabbath. It
          is customary with us to assemble together for prayer on that day,
          early, before dawn, sometimes in one house, then in another, so as
          to escape observation. And now, on the morrow—this assembly, which
          we term the Collect, will take place. Do thou tarry in thy chamber,
          and thou shalt be summoned when all have dispersed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, I would see and hear what takes
          place.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That may not be, Domitia, that is only for the
          initiated.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But why secrecy if there be naught of which to be
          ashamed?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Our Master said, Give not that which is holy unto
          dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine. Tell me, Domitia,
          how would you endure were your father made a mock of, his sayings
          and acts parodied on the stage, and turned into a matter of low
          buffoonery?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia’s brow
          flamed and her eyes flashed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I see your answer in your face. So with our Great
          Master. His mysteries are holy, and we would preserve them from
          outrage. Now you understand why you cannot be present.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But I would not mock.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is our rule, to avoid the chance of
          profanity.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As you will.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is one thing more,”</span> said Flavia.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You will not be angry if I have sent to
          have poor Glyceria brought here. Owing to her infirmity she has not
          been able to be present at a gathering of the Church <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for a long time, and nothing could give
          her greater consolation and happiness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am willing for anything that can cheer her,”</span>
          answered Domitia; then in a tone of vexation, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“So—a freedwoman, and Euphrosyne, a slave, will be
          admitted where I am shut out—I, who was Empress——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Do not be offended. Is it not so in every sodality,
          that the members of the Club alone attend the gatherings of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You are a Club then?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia was
          silent, then Flavia started up. <span class="tei tei-q">“I hear
          them—they have come with Glyceria. I must see that she be cared
          for. The long journey to that frail and broken frame will have
          exhausted her slender powers.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And I will go, too”</span>—with a tinge of jealousy in
          her manner. Domitia little liked that another should interest
          herself about the poor woman, and should stand to her in a more
          intimate relation than herself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On going forth,
          all feeling of envy disappeared at once before a sense of
          alarm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An accident had
          occurred on the way. Owing to some fault in the paving of the road,
          one of the bearers had stumbled and, in falling, the litter had
          been thrown down and the woman within injured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia saw by
          the ashen face and the green hue about the mouth and temples that
          Glyceria was in great pain. But her eyes were bright and sought her
          at once and a world of love flowed out of them, she put forth her
          thin hand to lay hold of the great lady. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Domitia at once flashed into anger.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“This comes of bringing her here. Had she
          been left at Gabii it would never have happened. Where is the
          fellow who threw her down?—Flavia! have him whipped with the
          scorpion.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glyceria caught
          her hand. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was an accident. He was not
          in fault. I am happy. It is the will of God—that is everything to
          me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You suffer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The paralyzed
          woman could not speak more. She was being lifted out of the litter,
          and fainted as she was moved. She was conveyed, in a condition of
          unconsciousness, to the room she was to occupy, a room opening out
          of the same corridor as that given up to Domitia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The family
          physician was summoned; he gave little hopes of the poor woman
          recovering from the shock, her natural strength and recuperative
          power had long ago been exhausted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All that evening
          Domitia remained silent, apparently in ill humor, or great
          distress, and Flavia Domitilla was unable to get many words from
          her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She retired
          early to rest, but could not sleep. Before going to her bed, she
          had visited the sick woman, and she convinced herself with her own
          eyes that the flame of the lamp of life was flickering to
          extinction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domitia loved
          the actor’s widow with all the passion of her stormy heart; and the
          thought of losing her was to her unendurable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night was
          still, balmy, and the heavens star-besprent. She looked from the
          corridor at the lights above, and then dropped the curtains over
          her door. She threw herself on her cushions, but her thoughts
          turned and tossed in her head.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She pressed her
          knuckles to her eyeballs to close her eyes, but could not force on
          sleep.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was to her as
          though every person whom she loved was taken from her; till she had
          no one left to whom her heart could cling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I vow a pig to Æsculapius!”</span> she said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“if he will recover her!”</span> and then
          impatiently turned to the wall. <span class="tei tei-q">“What can
          Æsculapius do? Whom has he succored at any time? He is but a
          name.”</span> To whom could she cry? What god of Olympus would
          stoop to care for—even to look at an actor’s widow, a poor Greek
          <span class="tei tei-corr">freedwoman.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gods! They
          revelled and drank Ambrosia; made love and deceived the simple, and
          lied and showed themselves to be arrant knaves. They were greedy of
          sacrifices, they accepted all that was given—but they gave nothing
          in return. Their ears were open to flattery, not to prayer. They
          were gods for the merry and rich, not for the miserable and
          poor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She thought she
          heard hasty steps in the passage, then voices. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And He! the God of Glyceria—why had not He saved her
          from this fall? Was He as powerless, as regardless, of His votaries
          as those of Olympus?”</span> Yes—something was the matter—there was
          a stir in the house—at that hour—at dead of night—Domitia’s heart
          bounded. Was Glyceria passing away?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She threw a
          mantle about her, and barefooted as she was, ran forth into the
          gallery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She saw at the
          further end a light at the door of the sick room, and sounds issued
          thence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly she
          flew thither, plucked aside the curtain, and stood in the doorway,
          arrested by the sight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Euphrosyne was
          seated on the bed, and had raised <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          against her in a sitting posture; Flavia Domitilla was there as
          well. Directly she saw Domitia she signed to her to approach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But
          Glyceria!—she was at once transfigured. Her face seemed to shine
          with a supernatural light—it had acquired a loveliness and
          transparency as of an angel—her eyes were upraised and fixed as in
          a trance, and her arms were outspread. She seemed not to weigh on
          Euphrosyne, but to be raised and sustained by supernatural
          power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The joy, the
          rapture in that sublimated countenance were beyond description. She
          saw, she knew, she felt none of those things that usually meet the
          senses. And yet Domitia, Flavia, were convinced that those
          illumined happy eyes looked on some One—were gazing into a light to
          themselves unseen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From her lips
          poured rapturous prayer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I see Thee! Thou—the joy of my heart, my hope and my
          portion forever! Thee whom I have loved and longed for! I hold
          Thee—I clasp Thy feet! O give her to me—the dear mistress! Take me,
          take me to Thyself—but ere I go—by Thy wounded hands—by Thy
          thorn-crowned head—by Thy pierced side—bring her to the light! To
          the light! To the light!”</span> And suddenly—with an instantaneous
          eclipse the illumination died off from her face, the tension was
          over, the arms, the entire body sank heavily against the bosom of
          Euphrosyne, the eyes closed; she heaved a long sigh, but a smile
          lingered about her lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Awed, not daring
          to draw nearer, unwilling to go back, Domitia stood looking.
          Neither did Flavia Domitilla stir.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a little
          while, however, the latter signed to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          would go.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She sleeps,”</span> she said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Glyceria’s
          bright eyes opened, and she said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the day
          began to break, from various quarters came men and women, in twos
          and threes to the house of Flavia Domitilla.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The visitor to
          Rome may see the very spot where stood her house and garden. For
          this good woman converted the latter into a place of sepulture for
          the Christians, and the catacomb that bears her name is one of the
          most interesting of those about Rome. Not only so, but the ruins of
          her villa remain, on the farm of Tor Marancia, or the Ardeatine
          Way. Here lived the widow of the martyr Clemens, with her
          sister-in-law, Plautilla, and her niece, of the same name as
          herself, all three holy women, serving God and ministering to the
          necessities of the poor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Collect, or
          assembly of the Faithful, was to take place in the atrium or hall
          of the villa. Domitilla had only Christian slaves with her in her
          country residence, and could trust them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the large
          mansions of the Roman nobility there were grand reception halls,
          called basilicas, with rows of pillars down the sides dividing them
          into a nave and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg
          343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>aisles, with an apse, or <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bema</span></span> as it was termed, at the
          end, in which the master of the house sat to receive his visitors.
          Here he and his clients, his parasites and friends walked, talked,
          declaimed, listened to readings, when the weather was wet or cold.
          At a later period, when the nobility became Christian, many of them
          gave up their basilicas to be converted into churches, and such is
          the origin of several churches of Rome. They never were, as some
          have erroneously supposed, halls of justice—they were, as
          described, the halls attached to the great Roman palaces.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But at the time
          I am speaking of, no such surrenders had been made. The great
          families had not been converted, only here and there, at rare
          intervals, some of their members had embraced the Gospel. But
          smaller people had become Christian, and these did temporarily give
          up the more public portion of the house, the atrium and tablinum
          for Christian worship. It was dangerous to thus assemble, and it
          would have been infinitely more dangerous had the assemblies taken
          place always at the same house. Accordingly it was contrived to
          vary the place of meeting and to give secret notice to the faithful
          where the gathering would be on the ensuing Lord’s day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The danger of
          these Collects was further reduced by their being held sometimes in
          the churches underground in the catacombs, or in the <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cellæ</span></span> near the tombs; and these
          gatherings passed uncommented on, as it was customary for the
          pagans to meet for a solemn banquet in the decorated chambers
          attached to their places of interment on the anniversaries of the
          death of their friends.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The various
          guilds also had their meeting for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>transaction of business, a sacred meal, and a
          sacrifice to the gods, and the early Christians were able so to
          copy the customs of the guilds or sodalities, as to carry on their
          worship undetected by the authorities, who supposed their
          assemblies were mere guild gatherings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hour was so
          early that lights were necessary, and lamps were suspended in the
          tablinum, which was raised a couple of steps above the floor of the
          hall.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Round the arc of
          the chamber, which was semi-circular, seats had been arranged, and
          in the centre against the wall one of more dignity than the rest,
          covered with white linen. In the midst of the tablinum at the top
          of the two steps was a table, and on one side a desk on legs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great care was
          taken at the door to admit none but such as could give the sign
          that they were Christians. The <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ostiarius</span></span> or porter in the early
          Church held a very important office, on his discretion much of the
          safety of the Church depended. He had to use the utmost caution
          lest a spy should slip in.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hall rapidly
          filled.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the steps
          into the apse lay Glyceria on a sort of bier, her hands folded, and
          her earnest eyes upraised! She had been gently, carefully conveyed
          thither, to be for the last time united in worship with the Church
          on earth, before she passed into the Church beyond.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On each side of
          the tablinum were curtains, that could be easily and rapidly drawn
          along a rod and so close the apse.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the atrium
          itself there were few lights. They were not needed, day would soon
          break.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the tablinum,
          against the wall, sat the presbyters with Clement, the bishop, in
          the centre. He was an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
          345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>old man, with a gentle face, full of love. He
          had been a freedman of the Flavians, and it was out of respect to
          them that he had taken the name of Clement, which was one of those
          in use in their family.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At his side, on
          the right hand, was one far more aged than he—one we have seen
          before, Luke the Physician and Evangelist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now one with a
          pair of clappers gave a signal and all rose who had been
          seated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A deacon
          standing at the top of the step said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Let
          us pray for the Emperor.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whereupon all
          the congregation responded as with a single voice: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lord, have mercy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Clement,
          the Bishop, prayed:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We beseech Thee, O
          Father, to look down upon the Emperor and to strengthen him against
          his foes, and to illumine his mind that he may rule in Justice, and
          be Thou his defence and strong tower.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon the
          deacon called again:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Let us pray for the
          magistrates.”</span> To which the people responded in the same
          manner, and the Bishop prayed in few terse words for the
          magistrates. In precisely similar manner was prayer made for the
          bishops and clergy, for all the faithful, for those in chains,
          working in mines, for the sick and the sorrowful, for the widows
          and orphans; it was as though a flood of all-embracing charity
          flowed forth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
          intercessions ended, Luke came to the desk, and a deacon brought
          the roll of the Law and unfolded it before him, and another held
          aloft a torch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He read as
          follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“This commandment which I command
          thee this day, it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off....
          But the word is very nigh <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg
          346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>thee in thy heart and in thy mouth, that thou
          mayest do it. See, I have set before thee life and good, and death
          and evil.... I call heaven and earth to record this day that I have
          set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore
          choose life&nbsp;... that thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and
          that thou mayest obey His voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto
          Him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
          Evangelist closed the roll and returned it to the deacon, and he
          spake some words of exhortation thereon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next came
          another deacon and unfolded the roll of the Prophets; and Luke
          read:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon
          me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto
          the meek; He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to
          proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to
          them that are bound. To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,
          and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn....
          To give to them that mourn beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
          mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that
          they might be called Trees of Righteousness, the Planting of the
          Lord, that He might be glorified.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then again Luke
          spoke a few simple words and declared how that the prophecy of old
          was fulfilled in Christ who was the healer of all sick souls, and
          the strengthener of all who were feeble, the restorer of the halt,
          the comforter of all that mourn, and the planter in the field of
          the Church of such as would grow up plants of righteousness to bear
          their fruit in due season.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And when he
          ceased, the congregation sang a psalm: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Praise the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me
          praise His holy name.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first age
          of the Church the liturgical service grew out of that of the
          synagogue. As in the latter there were the two lessons from Law and
          Prophet, so was there in the Church, but after the Psalm there were
          added to these, two more lessons, one from an Epistle by an Apostle
          and one from a Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time of
          our narrative the service was in process of formation and was not
          yet formed; and the sequence of Epistle and Gospel had not as yet
          been established. However, now Luke stood forward and said:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Beloved, we have a letter written by the Blessed
          John—the Disciple that Jesus loved, and therefrom I will read a few
          words.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he unfolded
          a short roll and read as follows:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
          upon us, that we should be called the sons of God! therefore the
          world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we
          the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but
          we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we
          shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him
          purifieth himself, even as he is pure.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He ceased, for a
          strange sound reached the ears of all—a sound that swelled and rose
          and then fell away and became all but inaudible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once again he
          began to read—and again this sound was heard.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is the message that ye heard from the beginning,
          that we should love one another.”</span></p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again he ceased,
          and looked round, and listened. For once more this strange wailing
          sound arose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as it
          declined, he resumed his reading.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We
          know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the
          brethren.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was
          constrained to cease.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then at a
          signal, two deacons went in the direction of the sound. And the
          whole congregation was hushed. But Glyceria, on her bed, lifted her
          hands and her eyes shone with expectation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently the
          deacons returned:—<span class="tei tei-q">“A woman—a weeping woman
          in a dark room.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Luke
          descended from the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bema</span></span>,
          and attended by them went in the direction of the voice, and came,
          where crouching, concealed, Domitia lay on the ground, sobbing as
          if her heart would break—they could not stay her—they did not
          try—they waited.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And presently
          she raised her face, streaming with tears, and said—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The light! the glorious light!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the sun rose
          over the roof, and shone down into the atrium, on the face of
          Glyceria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Flavia
          Domitilla stooped over her, laid her hand on her eyes and
          said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“In the Joy of thy Lord, Face to
          Face!”</span></p>

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
